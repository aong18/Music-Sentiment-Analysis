You reach your hands to me. A glimmer of hope. A mocking smile. You keep dragging me down. There comes a time. You lived for so long you feel safe. But dreams shatter. By a simple twist of fate. There you stand. A ghost refusing to fade away. Green turned into gray. I'll follow you to the grave. Can we be saved from days long gone?. Can we be saved from innocence lost?. I can't breathe. You reach your hands to me. A glimmer of hope. A mocking smile. You keep dragging me down",

To get inside you. Invading every thought. And every bit of your heart. Love can make you scream. and it can leave you speachless. Love has a thousand stems, but only one flower. It can grow alone till it turns into dust. It can tear your world apart. Or bind to you forever. It can grow in darkness, make its own light. Turn a curse into a kiss. change the meaning of your words. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. So infinitely vast and we're standing on the edge. Take my hand and erase the past forever. My love is you, my love you are. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love is never wrong and never needs a reason. I'm drowning in my tears. But my heart's on fire. It can make you better, it can change you slowly. And give you everything you want. Ask for nothing in return. In the blink of an eye, the hint of a smile. In the way you say goodbye. And everytime you find me. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire.

The voices tell me to do, but it's no use. I tried to own it, write songs about it. Believe me I tried. In the end I needed to breathe. Find inspiration, some kind of purpose. To take a second to face the shit. That makes me, me. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream. A couple years back and forth. With myself in a cage. Banging my head against the wall. Tryna put words on a page. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room, alone in a room. I saw the world a couple times. Tried to cure the ache with absence. But that hole was still a hole. And my mind kept playing tricks on me. Feeling older every day. Took everything I had to not crash and burn. But I'm starting to learn. Sometimes I'll fall down. Sometimes I'll lose hope. But those days will be few. If I keep my feet on the ground. I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here. So I keep pushing the limits of what makes me. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream. A couple years back and forth. With myself in a cage. Banging my head against the wall. Tryna put words on a page. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room, alone in a room. I can be better than I was. I can be better than I am.

That's honey to your ears. All that's sweet is yours. Loveliness you bring. I can't help but sing. All that's sweet is yours. When it seems I've broken down. When these chords are frail. You look with a smile and you say it's beautiful.",

Come on baby the laugh's on me. Stay on the streets of this town. And they'll be carving you up all right. They say you gotta stay hungry. Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight. I'm dying for some action. I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write. This book. I need a love reaction. Come on now baby gimme just one look. You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying.

Make you feel like your out of your mind. But please, I'm only asking to stay. You have such beautiful eyes. But what if they were not like mine. Will you love me anyway. I know you're freaking out now. But I won't mess things up mom. I'll try and be a hero for you. I just really hope that your heart is feeling better. Cos if you're happy I'm happy too. If your heart is broken. Fears making it all storming. Than just get the sadness out of here. I know I'm not in your arms. I know you still don't know me. But when it all goes wrong, I can feel. And now your belly is getting bigger. And you can't stop going prettier. You should know, you do. These tears falling down. Right now. I've dry then all cos you know. Mama I love you. Four months be patient. I'm begging you keep waiting. It was love that brought me to you. Five and I am bigger. And I bet the gifts you're getting. I'm coming now in pink. Maybe blue. And when the sixth month comes. Everyone can see. That mama you're not walking alone. Seven I can't help it. But daddy I'm so sorry. Mama is all mine. Don't you know. If your heart is broken. Fears making it all storming. Then just get the sadness out of here. I know I'm not in your arms. I know you still don't know me. But when it all goes wrong, I can feel. And now your belly is getting bigger. And you can't stop going prettier. You should know, you do. These tears falling down. Right now. I'll drive then all cos you know. Mama I love you. Eight months. Hang in there. I'm coming now, I promise. I've gotta find a way to reach you. 9 Months it's time now. The pain no long. So sorry that you had to bleed. Just so I could come. And now we both know the plans you made on your own. You keep them if they work for me too. I'm gonna wake you up. Right after you fall asleep. Will you still love me if I do. The first step that I'll take. Will be right into your arms. If I fall, please just hold me tight. And when I sense any fear. Your voice will come to me. And make me safe and sound the whole night. If your heart is broken. Fears making it all storming. Then just get the sadness out of here. I know I'm not in your arms. I know you still don't know me. But when it all goes wrong, I can feel.

He took the midnight train. Goin' anywhere. A singer in a smokey room. A smell of wine and cheap perfume. For a smile they can share the night. It goes on and on and on and on. Strangers waiting. Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights, people. Livin' just to find emotion. Hidin', somewhere in the night. Workin' hard to get my fill. Everybody wants a thrill. Payin' anything to roll the dice. Just one more time. Some will win, some will lose. Some were born to sing the blues. Oh, the movie never ends. It goes on and on and on and on. Strangers waiting. Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights, people. Livin' just to find emotion. Hidin', somewhere in the night. Don't stop believin'. Hold on to the feelin'. Streetlights, people...(2x). Don't Stop",

I'm frightened by the devil. And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid. I remember that time that you told me, you said. Love is touching souls. Surely you touched mine. Cause part of you pours out of me. In these lines from time to time. Oh you're in my blood like holy wine. You taste so bitter and so sweet. Oh I could drink a case of you darling. Still I'd be on my feet. I would still be on my feet. I met a woman. She had a mouth like yours. She knew your life. She knew your devils and your deeds. And she said. Go to him, stay with him if you can. But be prepared to bleed. Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine. You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet. Oh I could drink a case of you darling.

And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Out of the darkness and into the sun. I won't forget all the ones that I love. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Buildings with a hundred floors. Swinging round revolving doors. Maybe I don't know where they'll take me. But, gotta keep moving on, moving on. Fly away, break away. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta. Take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Out of the darkness and into the sun.

Than love that you breathe. Forever hold me. Many rivers to cross. But our love will guide us. It´s all we need. (Chorus). There will be those times that test our faith. On some of the roads that we have to take. But I know that we´ll always find our way. Cause love never fails Love never fails",

I need your love to keep on breathing. Chorus 2. Oh yes I found a Dream For Two. Secret heaven. So powerful it leaves us defenseless. I know this is a Dream For Two. Deep inside me.

Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all. I get home, I got the munchies. Binge on all my Twinkies. Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep. And I drank up all my money. Dazed and kinda lonely. You're gone and I got to stay high. All the time to keep you off my mind. High all the time to keep you off my mind. Spend my days locked in a haze. Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down. Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you. Pick up daddies at the playground. How I spend my daytime. Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive. I'll make it fast and greasy. I'm numb and way too easy. You're gone and I got to stay high. All the time to keep you off my mind. High all the time to keep you off my mind. Spend my days locked in a haze. Tryin to forget you babe, I fall back down. Got to stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you. Standing in my play pretend. Where the fun ain't got no end. Can't go home alone again. Need someone to numb the pain. Staying in my play pretend. Where the fun ain't got no end. Can't go home alone again. Need someone to numb the pain. You're gone and I got to stay high. All the time to keep you off my mind. High all the time to keep you off my mind. Spend my days locked in a haze. Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down. Got to stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you",

Come on, come on, give me a kiss. You are the one I really miss. Let's work it out. Let's leave for the mountains. We can live on top of the hill. We've come this far and we always will **. Binding in the breeze is easy. A sand storm can tear us apart. Let's forget the drama. And create a new start. I know what you can say. But, you're so wrong, baby. Stay, stay. I never put anyone in our way. My love for you is day and night, night and day. * Repeat. ** Repeat",

'Til sun down when I come through. I need a girl like you, yeah yeah. Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too. What I want when I come through. I need a girl like you, yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah. I need a girl like you, yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah. I need a girl like you, yeah yeah. I need a girl like you, yeah yeah. I need a girl like you. Maybe it's 6: 45. Maybe I'm barely alive. Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time. Maybe I know that I'm drunk. Maybe I know you're the one. Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive. 'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me. 'Til sun down when I come through. I need a girl like you, yeah yeah. Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars. No, it's really rude if I let you meet my mama. You don't want a girl like me I'm too crazy. For every other girl you meet its fugazy. I'm sure them other girls were nice enough. But you need someone to spice it up. So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi. Come and rev it up like Harley, Harley. Why is the best fruit always forbidden?. I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit. The red light, red light stop, stop (skrrt). I don't play when it comes to my heart. (let's get it though). I don't really want a white horse and a carriage. I'm thinkin' more of a white Porsches and karats. I need you right here 'cause every time you call. I play with this kitty like you play with your guitar. 'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me. 'Til sun down when I come through. I need a girl like you, yeah yeah.

Like something's about to happen. But I don't know what. If that means, what I think it means. We're in trouble, big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say. I'm not taking any chances. You were just what the doctor ordered. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms. Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?. They said I rap like a robot. So call me Rapbot. But for me to rap like a computer. Must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a living and a killing off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack. I'm an Mc still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with). This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop. You don't really wanna get into a pissing match. With this rappidy rap. Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac. Pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac. And at the exact same time. I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts. While I'm practicing that. I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic. I was under Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow?. All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are having a rough time period. Here's a maxipad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms. Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?. Let me show you maintaining. This shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key. And the secret to rap immortality like I have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage. And youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the moon since. Mc's get taken to school with this music. Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme. Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2pac N. W. A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy. Thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up. Blow up and be in a position. To meet Run Dmc and induct them. Into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I walk in the church. And burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it's all a game. 'Til I walk a flock of flames. Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?. Little gay looking boy. So gay I can barely say it. With a straight face looking boy. You witnessing a massacre. Like you watching a church gathering. Take place looking boy. Oy vey, that boy's gay. That's all they say looking boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a way to go from your label everyday. Looking boy. Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?. I got a \"hell yeah\" from Dre looking boy. I'mma work for everything I have. Never ask nobody for shit. Get outta my face looking boy. Basically boy you're never gonna be capable. To keep up with the same pace looking boy. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I'm racing around the track. Call me Nascar, Nascar. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park. The White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton. No Asgard, Asgard. So you be Thor and I'll be Odin. You rodent, I'm omnipotent. Let off then I'm reloading immediately. With these bombs I'm totin'. And I should not be woken. I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head. A zombie floating. But I got your mom deep throating. I'm out my ramen noodle. We have nothing in common, poodle. I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm. And pay homage, pupil. It's me, my honesty's brutal. But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere. In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle. Enough rhymes to maybe to try. And help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case. 'Cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry looking at me. Like it's lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big. And here they come trying to censor you. Like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\". From the Marshall Mathers Lp. One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine. Put 'em all in a line, add an Ak-47, a revolver and a nine. See if I get away with it now. That I ain't as big as I was. But I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal. You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though. And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows. You're like normal, fuck being normal. And I just bought a new Raygun from the future. To just come and shoot ya like. When Fabolous made Ray J mad. Cause Fab said he looked like a fag. At Maywhether's pad. Singin' to a man while they played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24 7 special. On the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day. ''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''. Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed. (Jj Fad). Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa. You assuming I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you. I'm superhuman. Innovative and I'm made of rubber. So that anything you saying. Ricocheting off of me. And it'll glue to you. I'm never stating. More than never demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience. A feeling like it's levitating. Never fading. And I know that the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off. They'd be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. Oh, he's too mainstream. Well, that's what they do. When they get jealous, they confuse it. It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it. I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use. Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm ripping any one of these verses. Diverse as you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to prove. That if you're half as nice at songs. You can sacrifice virgins too. School flunkie, pill junky. But look at the accolades the skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself cause I make me do. What I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues. But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel. I'm asleep in the front seat. Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still \"Chunky, But Funky\". But in my head there's something. I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils. Here's what they want from me. They asking me to eliminate. Some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration. The bitter hatred that I had. Then you may be a little patient. And more symphatetic to the situation. And understand the discrimation. But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then. But if I can't batter the women how the fuck. Am I supposed to bake them a cake then?. Don't mistake it for Satan. It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas. And take a vacation to trip a broad. And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard. Be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?",

Carry on, carry on. As if nothing really matters. Too late, my time has come. Sends shivers down my spine. Body's aching all the time. Goodbye everybody, I've got to go. Gotta leave you all behind. And face the truth. Mama, oh!. (Anyway the wind blows). I don't want to die. But sometimes wish. I'd never been born at all. I see a little silhouette of a man. Scaramouche, Scaramouche.

Shawty loving you. Loving you shawty loving you. Loving you shawty loving you. Loving you shawty loving you. Shine the rest of the stars are watching. You're awesome you're unique for all time. Wind your body from the bottom. To your crown you're a queen you're divine. That's my goals. It's temporary. That's just how it goes (how it goes). What I hated, now I love the most (I love the most). Mother told me don't let nothing stop me. Cause ain't no copies. Baby you're a one-off. Time to start loving you. Shawty loving you. Loving you shawty loving you. Loving you shawty loving you. Loving you shawty loving you. Shine the rest of the stars are watching. You're awesome you're unique for all time.

You are in his graces too. The world's entertaining you. Cause they see the day in you. Forget who was playing you. Cause they die in their game too. Shine the rest of the stars are watching.

Everytime I rhyme. \"Forever and ever!\". For ever ever? for ever ever? ever ever?. Ever ever? ever ever? ever ever? ever ever?. [Verse 1]. Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still. People lose hands, legs, arms for real. Little was known of Sierra Leone. And how it connect to the diamonds we own. When I speak of Diamonds in this song. I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glown. I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain. These ain't conflict diamonds,is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne. See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',. How? when I know of the blood diamonds. Though it's thousands of miles away. Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today. Over here, its a drug trade, we die from drugs. Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs. The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses. I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless. 'til I seen a picture of a shorty armless. And here's the conflict. It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold. Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice. On a polar rugby it look so nice. How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?. 'fore I beat myself up like Ike. You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. [Kanye]. People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh). That'll be the same day I give the game back (uh). You know the next question dog 'yo, where Dame at?'(uh). This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!). 'wassup wit you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man?'. [Jay-Z]. Yep!. I got it from her 'ye damn!. The chain remians, the gang is in tact. The name is mine, I'll take blame for that. The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? (laughs). Part of me I had to laugh at that. How could you falter when you're the rock of gibralter. I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water. This ain't no tour order, this is nothin to me. Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week. I do this in my sleep,. I sell Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's. I'm not a buisness man I'm a buisness, man. Let me handle my buisness, damn!. Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy. YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me. Bleek could be one hit away his whole career. As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire. And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere. So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah. He don't even have to write rhymes. The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes. Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly. What I was sayin practically me whole carreer. The diamond is forever, I been mindin' this forever. Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better. People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'. Instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix. If you watin for the end, the dynasty signed. And what seemed like forever is a mighty long time. I'm young bitches [laughs]. Goodnight!",

So I'ma get my money. Let's go. Now, I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy. This is an aristocracy. I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolately. What's up with who? That's old news. I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes. Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cool. I might walk in Nobu with no shoes. \"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods!. That nigga crazy, I told you!\". Immature adult (uh huh), insecure asshole (what else?). And if you fall on the concrete, that's yo' ass fault. If you pass on a Kon beat, that's yo' last fault.

Cute, your shorty watch Barneys, we at de Bonny's. End up at Marley, Georgi, and service from Sergio. Da Kine Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo. I know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical. This the Christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two. Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder 'Ye. 'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae. I got styled last June and she heard of me. I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate. First of all, we all know the beats is. Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus. Imagine the direction of this Immaculate conception. Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is paegantries. Cannonball off the diving board when I aboard. All my homies Gds, but I am lord. Rap god, Greek mythology. And this life too crazy to think logically. Here's something that you could use in analogy. My life is like a child's illusions become reality. Now go get my throne.

I guess every superhero need his own theme music. No one man should have all that power. The clock's tickin', I just count the hours. Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power. (21st century schizoid man). The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons. open. We ain't got nothin' to lose, ma'fucka, we rollin'. Huh? Ma'fucka, we rollin'. With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands. In this white man world, we the ones chosen. So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'. Huh? I see you in the mornin'. This is way too much, I need a moment. No one man should have all that power. The clock's tickin', I just count the hours. Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power.

My ice, brought the Dodies in. Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic. He know, he so, fuckin' gifted. I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts. Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own. vault. My childlike creativity, purity and honesty. Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts. Reality is catchin' up with me. Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody. With these responsibilities that they entrusted me. As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece. Nigga, no one man should have all that power. The clock's tickin', I just count the hours. Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power. 'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours. And then they. And then they. And then they. And then they.

                  "Lyric": "[Intro: Jay-Z (Kanye)]. [laughing]. Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker. Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room. 'Cause they don't fucking... (I'd like to propose a toast). (I said toast motherfucker). [Chorus: Kanye]. And I am. And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them. Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky. This is the last call for alcohol, for the... So get your ass up off the wall. [Verse 1]. The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac. The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc. I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame. And come back next year with the whole fucking game. Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top. They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop. Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself. Rocafella's only niggaz that help. My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair. Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here. They say he bourgie, he big-headed. Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is. Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds. I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas. It's funny how wasn't nobody interested. 'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir. Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir. Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest. But all they got left is this guy called West. Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def. Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z. I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh. It come out sweeter than old Sadie. Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards. Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards. And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye. I'm almost reignin'. Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?. It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him. Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine. Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme. Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem. Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams. I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed. But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh. So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more. You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more. You can't say shit to Kanye West no more. I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga. I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don. Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom. I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards. I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars. I went to the malls and I balled too hard. 'Oh my god, is that a black card?'. I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term. African American Express. Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell. Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to. Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips. [Chorus]. \"... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz\". [Outro]. So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop. picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin?\". I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\". Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone. going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats. And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers. cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with. And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"look man, you wanna mess with Kanye. you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\". [No ID:] \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\". I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not. but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer. [Hiphop:] \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\",. I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production. But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know. After they picked that Truth beat. I was figuring I was gonna do some more work. But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago. I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts. just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy. get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something. or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then. I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample. I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like \"oh, yo that shit is crazy. Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.\". And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me. so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like. with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style. when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'. And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album. I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound. You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time. I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with. Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm. sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did. for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he. gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I. came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, \"oh. you a real soulful dude\" [Jay-Z: \"you a real soulful dude\"]. And he. uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got. to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said. [Jay-Z:] \"check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\". \"tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking. like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't. want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my. personal opinion. So he asked me, \"what you think of it?\". [Jay-Z:] \"so what you thinkin?\". And I was like, \"man that shit tite,\". you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train. man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just. in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got. acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like. poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one. of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through. my production company, but he ended up going straight with the. company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad. news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at. the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took. that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about. ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal. with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to. [Mother:] \"Come on, let's just go\". Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.. I remember I pulled up. [Mother:] \"Kanye, baby, we're here\",. I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a. bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and. the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'. And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up. there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I. played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone. he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at. that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket. hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said. \"yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And. really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.. [Hiphop:] \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\".. And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that. GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of. them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen. Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like \"yo what's up I'm Kanye.\". [Dame:] \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\". \"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?. Yo, this nigga got classics\". [Dame:] \"Jay got classics, G.\". You know I ain't talkin shit.. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm. still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show. The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my. eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all. these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one. thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be. Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton. sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John. Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the. time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I. spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical. shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his. eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap. was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.. He said \"man that was tite.\". [Jay-Z:] \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\". That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.. Okay, fast forward.. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just. took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship. with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my. career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me. to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at. this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had. relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so. they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound. like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them. these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll. be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy. 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they. didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked. with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the. company that'll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my. nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man. [Jessica:] \"Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\". I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up. \"Y'all niggaz is stupid\". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.. The nigga that was behind me, I mean,. he wasn't even a nigga, you know?. The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol. Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.. [Joe:] \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\". Dame was like, \"yo you got a deal with Capitol,. okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\". [Dame:] \"you gotta make sure it's not wack.\". Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to. play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and. Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll. never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'. \"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow. I got eleven plaques on my walls right now. You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\". Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So. I play that song for him, and he's like \"oh shit\". [Dame:] \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\". \"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\". [Dame:] \"it's actually kinda hot.\". Like they still weren't looking at me. like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole. album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and. save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's. like \"yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick\". [Dame:] \"you don't wanna catch a brick\". You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with. that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was. already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you. know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I. was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm. not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer. rapper\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--. the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio. sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes. man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said. \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\". [Mel:] \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\". And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested. and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying. to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I. called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?\"",

We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive. Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse One:]. If this is your first time hearing this. You are about to experience something cold man. We never had nothing handed took nothing for granted. Took nothing from no man, man i'm my own man. But as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman. Only adult man i knew that wasnt a broke man. Flickin starter coats man, Man you ount no man. We don't care what people say. This is for my niggas outside all winter. Cuz this summer they aint finna to say next summer im finna. Sittin in the hood like community colleges. This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship. Cause aint no to tuition for havin no ambition. And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home. So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job. You gotta do something man your ass is grown. [Chorus]. [Kanye West:]. Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high. Kids Sing Kids Sing. . [Kanye and Kids:]. We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive. Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse Two:]. The second verse is for my dogs working 9 to 5. That still hustle cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55. And everybody selling make-up, Jacobs. And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up. We put shit on layaway then come back. We claim other kids on our income tax. We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid. And we don't care what people say. Momma say she wanna move south. Scratchin lottery tickets Eyes on a new house. Around the same time Doe ran up in dudes house. Couldnt get a job. So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work. The drug game bolemic its hard to get weight. So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight. So we gon keep baking to the day we get cake.. And we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus]. [Kanye West and Kids:]. Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high. Kids Sing Kids Sing. We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive. Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse Three:]. You know the kids gonna act a fool. When you stop the programs for after school. And they DCFS them some of them dislecsic. They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions. We scream, rock, blows, weed park. so now we smart. We aint retards the way teachers taught. Hold up hold fast we make mo'cash. Now tell my momma i belong in the slow class. It's bad enough we on welfare. You trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair. Im trying to get the car with the chromy wheels here. You tryin to cut our lights like we dont live here. Look at whats handed us our fatheres abandoned us. When we get the hammers gone and call the ambulance. Sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us. But we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus]. [Kanye West and Kids:]. drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high. Kids Sing Kids Sing. We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive.

Today, I seriously thought about killing you. I contemplated, premeditated murder. And I think about killing myself. And I love myself. Way more than I love you, so. Today, I thought about killing you. Premeditated murder. You'd only care enough. To kill somebody you love. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always inside the darkest. (mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhmm). Just say it out loud to see how it feels. People say, \"don't say this, don't say that\". Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels. Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table. Today I thought about killing you. Premeditated murder. I think about killing myself. And I, I love myself way more than I love you. The most beautiful thoughts. Are always besides the darkest. (mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhmm). I think this is the part. Where I'm supposed to say somethin' good. To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad. But sometimes I think really bad things. Really, really, really bad things. And I love myself way more than I love you. See, if I was tryin'. To relate it to more people. I'd probably say. I'm struggling with loving myself. Because that seems like a common theme. But that's not the case here. I love myself way more than I love you. And I think about killing myself. So, best believe. I thought about killing you today. Premeditated murder. I called up my loved ones. I called up my cousins. I called up the muslims. Said I'm 'bout to go dumb. Get so bright, it's no sun. Get so loud, I hear none. Screamed so loud, got no lungs. Hurt so bad, I go numb. Time to bring in the drums. That prrt-pu-pu-pum. Set the newtone on 'em. Set the nuke off on 'em. I need coke with no rum. I taste coke on her tongue. I don't joke with no one. They'll say he die so young. I done had a bad case of too many bad days. Got too many bad traits. Used the floor for ashtrays. I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache. I'ma make my name last. Put that on my last name. It's a different type of rules that we obey. Ye, ye, ye season, nigga, we old bay. We was all born to die, nigga doa. Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cape. Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah. I don't see no, mhm, mhm. If I wasn't shinin' so hard. Wouldn't be no shade. Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay. Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age. I thought I was past my deebo ways. Even when I went broke, I ain't break. How you gon' hate? nigga, we go way back. To when I had the braids. And you had the wave cap. Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way asap. Don't get socked in the mouth. You know homie don't play that. Pay the fire marshal bill. 'cause this shit done got way packed. They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape). All you gotta do is speak on ye. All you gotta do is speak on ye. Don't get your tooth chipped like frito-lay",

Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get down. [Jay-Z]. Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts. First I had they ear, now I have their heart. Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start. I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart. Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons. I seen them re-po'd, re-sold then re-driven. So when I reload, he holds #1 position. When you hot I'm hot. And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin. It's plain to see, niggaz can't fuck with me. Cuz I'm a be that nigga for life. This is not an image, this is God given. This is hard livin, mixed with crystall sippin. It's the most consistent, Hov. Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and. Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin. It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap. I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy. [Chorus overlapping last four lines]. [Kanye West]. I get down for my grandfather who took my momma. Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat. At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in. And with that in my blood I was born to be different. Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership. But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership. Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin it. Racisms still alive, they just be concealin it. But I know they don't want me in the damn club. They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club. I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed. Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times. But in the land where niggaz praise Yukons and getting paid. Its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved. Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves. Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away. So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter. And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up. And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her. You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up. But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye. Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye. First Aaliyah now romeo must die?. I know I got angels watchin me from the other side. [Chorus]. [J.Ivy]. We are all here for a reason on a particular path. You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math. Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious. That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world. I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls. I'm not just another individual. My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual. But I get my hymns from him. So it's not me it's he that's lyrical. I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument. My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes. For your soul and your mental. That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into. Yeah I need my loot by rent day. But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte. I'm tryna give us us free like Sinke. I can't stop, that's why I'm hot. Determination, dedication, motivation. I'm talking to you of my many inspirations. When I say I can't let you or self down. If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff. And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life. In my grip I would never ever let you down. And when these words are found. Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed. With a language called love. That's why my breath is felt by the death. And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind. I too dream in color and in rhyme. So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house. Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth. A touch of god reigns out. [Chorus]. [Jay-Z]. Who else you know been hot this long. Started from nothing but he got this strong. Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you. Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special. Let you tell it man I'm fallin well. Somebody must have caught hi'm cuz. Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan em. Number one albums what I got, like four of em. More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way. Clear the way, I'm here to stay. Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that. This is Jay, dissin Jay will get you Mase'd. When I start spittin them lyrics niggaz get very religious. Six hail mary's please father forgive us. Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggaz. They way y'all all follow Jigga. Hov's a livin legend and I'll tell you why. Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive",

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til they drifted Pangaea. I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia. Treat the demons just like Pam. I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn Gina. I been this way since Arthur was anteater. Now they wanna hit me with the woo-wap the bam. Tryna snap photos of familia. My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her. You can feel the lyrics and spirit coming in braille. Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail. I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell. I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail. Hesaid let's do a good ass job with Chance three. I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy. Let's make it so free and the bars so hard. That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet. This is my part, nobody else speak. This is my part, nobody else speak. This little light of mine. Glory be to God, yeah. I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go. If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats. Know what God said when he made the first rainbow. Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro. Ugh, I'm just having fun with it. You know that a nigga was lost. I laugh in my head. Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt. Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike. You cannot mess with the light. Look at lil Chano from 79. We're on an ultralight beam. We're on an ultralight beam. This is a God dream. This is a God dream. This is everything. Everything. (Yes darling. Hallelujah). I'm tryna keep my faith. (Yes, Jesus). But I'm looking for more. Somewhere I can feel safe. And end my holy war. I'm tryna keep my faith. Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough. This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up.

And if ya losin yo high than smoke again. KEEP EM HIGH. [Verse 1: Kanye West]. N-n-n-now, my flow. Is in the pocket like Wallace, I got the bounce like hydrolics. I can't call it, I got the swerve like alchoooool-ics. My freshman year I was goin through hell, a problem. Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta collllllll-ege. My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me. I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna folllllllllll-ow. My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks. You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see. I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this. bastard's flow will bash a skull. And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro.

E-mailin me at 11:26, tellin me that she 36-26, plus double-d. You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubblee. At NYU but she headed from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chillin on. campus. Sent me a picture with a feelin on Candice. Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis. W-H-I-T, it's gettin late mami, your screen saver say tweet. So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend. His name Kweli. (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib). I mean. (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib). I mean. (You don't really know him, why is you lyin). Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line. She gon' think that I'm lyin, just spit a couple of lines. Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high. . [Verse 3: Talib Kweli]. Yeah. I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin up dolls but. GET EM HIGH, I need some tracks you tryin to pull tracks out. And my rhymes as fittin to blow you tryin to blow back south. Well ok, you twisted my arm, I'll asist with the charm, aiyyo. I though you meet that chickit that got friends with yo moms. And she's the bomb, boy she got the boujI behavior. Always got somethin to say like a bookee playa hater. Anyway, I don't usualy fuck a interneter. Draws stuck to they arm like Nicorette. You really fuckin that much, you tryin to get off cigarettes. And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet. I appoligize if I come off a little inconsiderate. I got the bubble cushion a sister could get ahead of it. [Verse 4: Common]. Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke. A high filled with dope. Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes. The real nigga quotes. Real rappers is hard to find, like a remonte, control rap is not a. Used soup it still got life, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs. Rock clubs, it's like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show. Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggaz in you. You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you. How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead. I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is to sexy to even make songs like these. That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys. To many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is populer. Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin her. Album, how come, you the hot garbager. The years clear your image and snooped up. Label got you souped up, tellin you you sick. Man you a dick with a loose nut. Video hard to watch like Medusa. Even your club record need a booster. Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illeaterate nigga. Read the infa, red across your head I'm bread king like Simba. Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper. You dansin for money like honey, I did this my way. So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye. Spittin through wires and fires, emcees retirin. Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then. [Chorus: Kanye West]. N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands. GET EM HIGH. All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin man. GET EM HIGH.

Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night). They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off. Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off. Colors drippin' off. Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters. Niggas is pimps, niggas is players. 'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious. Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma. 'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture. Not somethin' to conquer. I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster. Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly. I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin. Nigga, do we have a problem?. Matter of fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers. I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges. No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters. Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates. Just play piano and stick to karate. I pray your body's draped more like mine. And not like your mommy's. Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts. And I am a nigga, I know what they want. I pray that you don't get it all at once. Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net. All in the comments, you wanna vomit. That's your baby, you love her to death. Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends. You break a glass and say it again. She can't comprehend the danger she in. If you whoop her ass, she move in with him. Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again. But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?. Let's pray we can put this behind us. I swear that these times is the wildest. She got the scars, they serve as reminders. Blood still on her pajamas. But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence. Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar. 'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters. Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters. Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters. Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw. It was all part of the story, even the scary nights.

And anybody who plays sports, you know you got politics. And you got all the other bullshit. So I'mma talk about a little bit of that. And I'mma stop rappin' and start rappin' now. So drop the slam and let's get sick. [Verse 1: Wale]. Halfback toss to right. Yeah the coach used to say I was awesome, right. O.D. was in the weight room all his life. But I was more self concerned with the broads in life. Im always on the yard like farmers. Never in class. Dorm room hoppin' if workouts optional. Im not rockin'. I can run an option best in my conference. Look at my accomplishments, I'm all county. You double A niggas should be lucky y'all signed me. Lucky y'all found me, lucky y'all stole me. I could be with Bowden, I could be with Friedgen. Two a day curfews, where's my Freedom?. School ain't even start yet, there ain't not freaks here. Might as well prepare. Season opener, finna be there. When the depth chart came, there was no me there. I mean me is there, but it's like three there. Which made me have to wait like leap year. Cause I ain't really lift weights, I didn't need them. I run a 4.4, so they won't catch me there. Knocking on my coach door like a missionary. Playbook like a Oxford dictionary. Attitude that was not really felling. And he put me on ice, I was oxen literally. I keep talking, I keep talking. My scholarship won't straight like Rodman. So Im walking. Fuck it, Im leaving. Vsu next season. Peace. [Hook: Kanye West]. I need you right now. I need you right now. You know how long I've been on ya. Since Prince was on Apollonia. Since O.J. had Isotoners. Don't act like I never told ya. [Verse 2: Wale]. They say, Trojans never break but it ain't that. For God sake, you can call coach Faison. I've seen dreams turn dust, cause he made them. Cause he played them, when he ain't played them. I've seen niggas loose cool, niggas leave school. And back to the block with nothing better to do. Vsu don't regret you. Just regret the fact that I left too soon. I got kicked off, I used to shit talk. Excuse my complaint, but I got to get it off. Hey Mr. coach, I don't like you. You don't me, that don't mean I gotta move. You see the way I move, I am in another gear. You can ask Los, I was like a young Gayle. My coach ain't care, so I ain't care. He ain't even respect the name, he said Whale. So I said yeah, and he was like yeah. You fumbled in a drill, young man get on the hill. So Im like fuck it, Im out get on your head. Such Karma, next year they 4-6. A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit. And now I only listen to this hip-hop shit. A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit. Man fuck this shit. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Wale]. I go, in when I start putting words out. Words sharp like a Jerry Rice curl route. Im moonshine, y'all merlot. I got on, and I gotta thank Marlon. Thank Kenny Burns, though we not talking. But my squad like the 72' Dolphins. Climate Shula, my flow Csonka. Im so Bonkas, Im not conscious. They are not confident when Im talking. Make them more insecure when they caught one. He tried tossing to Andre Johnson. Now Im getting compliments on how charming I am. And Im way out London, way out conscious. Y'all never seen. Exclusives, y'all never seen. They wait on my return, I am Az-Zahir Hakim. Write it in my leisure, I rather go shopping. Gucci & Nike, that's what I call an option. Um Tom Frazier, new Lebron haters. Got you niggas all over my bars just like Frasier. I've become immune to you no name haters. They can not pause like right one sega. I get inspired about your make up. You no good like a stripper with a \"A\" cup. Young Arrington, coming for you Aikman. Aye Jay, 8 grand skins gonna take that. Aye Bo, 10 stacks on the Patriots. Aye Rich, another 5 on the G Men. Another 5, Eli won't even be there. No Strahan, y'all need to rebuild. Back to you homo spittin so, so. You can't kick it like Romo hold for ya. No more for the broke I am more so. A first rounder, y'all don't want a Russell. I must go like fly route. My tires align with the play, but the times out. Yeah hail Mary full of grace. I swear these off rhyme bums are full of hate. Young Peyton don't huddle, still run my play. Still run that break, still get my ring, still run my shit. And it ain't no thing, you in Dungy's dungeon. So get that straight, yeah get that straight. Ain't nothing to Peyton. I am Marvin with mind, but I listen to Wayne. And I listen to 'Ye. Still listen to Big. And I listen to Jay. They are the coaches in this. And I listen to thought. And I listen to Common. We have nothing in Common. The shit that I spit is more",

The concept of school seems so securre. Sophmore three yearrs aint picked a careerr. She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair. Cause that's enough money. to buy her a few pairs of new Airs. Cause her baby daddy don't really care. She's so precious with the peer pressure. Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus. (a Lexus). She had hair so long that it looked like weave. Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve. And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe. Single black female addicted to retail and well. [Chorus - repeat (w Kanye ad-libs) ]. Oh when it all, it all falls down. I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down. [Verse - Kanye West]. Man I promise, I'm so self conscious. That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches. Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy. I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!. Then I spent 400 bucks on this. Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!. And I can't even go to the grocery store. Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team. It seems we living the american dream. But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things. For the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us. floss cause they degrade us. We trying to buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop. Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop coupe. [Chorus - repeat (w Kanye ad-libs) ]. Oh when it all, it all falls down. I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down. [Verse - Kanye West]. I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em. We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom. We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em. Things we buy to cover up what's inside. Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth. That's why shortys hollering where the ballas' at?. Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack. And a white man get paid off of all of that. But I ain't even gon act holier than thou. Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou. Before I had a house and I'd do it again. Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz. I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific. I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific. I got a problem with spending before I get it. We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it. [Chorus - to fade (w Kanye ad-libs) ]. Oh when it all, it all falls down. I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down",

And I drive so fast I blur the light post. They say Drive Slow, I say \"I know\". Then errrr, away I go. And the way I flew. In this year or two. I know this is what God put me here to do. But in this excitement. You just might miss. A shorty with a demo like \"Hey, you might like this\". And see. He. Remind me of me. Just a year ago. Now he. Tellin' me. I'm his her-ro-oh. I took his Cd and asked him what he's lookin' for. He said, \"Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle\". [Patti Labelle]. Time, they say (true story, [kanye west]). There ain't no way. Your dreams are gone see the light of day. Don't believe. That you can't achieve. Whatever you're after. You can't be swayed. By the simple minds. That wanna hold you down. And in his time. When you. Get with. We'll be not far behind. [Hook: Patti Labelle]. If you listen to the sermons. And ask the Lord for guidance. You will see the many blessings (blessings you have received). When you give Him all the glory (glory). Gonna talk to, don't ignore thee (ignore thee). Listen to all the stories. You can do anything. [Consequence]. Look at my injured arm. My shoulder I know he's been warning me. To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be. Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be. But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave. And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave. But the women be callin' me. The liquor be callin' me. Bitches be Cons, took a stripper named Diamond. If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds. And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in. So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him. I open up the Book and the message is clear. But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there. To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens. To bag up the work that they give out to fiends. But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean.

Swanging my do's wide open, making you niggaz mouth drop. Tops drop on cops, but bops we wreck shop. S.L.A.B. wrecking your spot, boy this here won't stop. We some certified wreckers, on the track we molesters. Got the cheese like Chester, boys bet not test us. We gon glide like Clyde, North-East-West and Southside. It really don't matter, represent it with pride. [Trae]. Well it's the wood grain grabber, fo' do' glass skater. Tinted up like Darth Vader, when I slide pass haters.

Bitch-made nigga knocker, and a bop type stopper. With B and Jay at the spot, with them dots on stock. Looking like a helicopter, when I crawl down blocks. While my chrome be spinning, iced out when I'm grinning. I know I need to stop sinning, when I'm fucking with women. Cause I'm a G by nature, I get the game from my brother. I'm on the Belt burning rubber, born and raised in the gutter. [Jay'Ton]. I'm still swanging up in a drop, and steady running from cops. With golds across the top of my mouth, swanging the lot. While looking for yellow bops, you know it don't never stop. With trunks waving the block, with Reese and Lil' Pop. We some Down South playas, and flipping in Navigators. For niggaz that's talking down, we pop the trunk on the haters. I'm steady pumping for paper, from Houston on to the Caders. The only thing that I know, is to drop and slide on them skaters. [Hook - 2x]. [Pimp Skinny]. Steady acting bad, moving fast as I dash. It's this nigga named Pimp Skinny, stay up on the mash. Bleeding for the cash, with the drop and then I dash. All you bitch ass niggaz, gon feel for that. Gun clapper ass slapper, close the chapter. S.L.A.B. nigga ass waxer, underground punch will never be a factor. For the real track master, doing it like a G. Cause I'm a wicked flow master. [T-2]. I'm flipping with the S.L.A.B., give your boy dap. You say you my partna hicka-hicka damn, quit making me laugh. Cause you making me, stop my car. You'll be laying six feet, in a do' in the hearse. I'm putting in work, playboy I'm writing my own rhymes. Doing my shows in different places, buy my own shine. Chill and recline, got my life made. My platinum in my mouth, like it was cleaned with Cascade. Could it be, the ice in my mouth. I'm still-I'm still, T-2 from the block. Use to have a little, but I have a lot. Southside of H-Town, is where I came from (yes sir). [Hook - 2x]. [Kiotti]. Don't be fooled, by the rocks that I got. I'm still-I'm still, Kiotti with a glock. See me in a drop, pulling on your block. And I ride Sprewell, cause I guess I got tired of chops. In my throwback. Maybe brick 4 red Mustang, that's a jet car. You know me, young Kiotti. Baya-bay and I hang on the block, like clouds on gray days. When I pull through, it's like whoa. Niggaz see me coming, rims stop then go. Man I got a whole, lot of cash to blow. I mash hard, with them S.L.A.B. niggaz swanging down your 'Vard. [Maurice]. Crawling through the scene, Benz lime freaky green. Too big to be a machine, falling screens submarine. Swanging from coast to coast, I never brag never boast. On a Rolls Royce man, I'm eating scrambled eggs and toast. Hard top Testarosta, when I slide down 'Boule's. Double header watch me swinging my blades, chop like swarms. I'm wrecking mics for rewards, I'm cracking dats in the cars. 84's or vogues, I do the do like more. [Hook - 2x]",

Still like that butterfly like Mariah. Show me the money the black Jerry Mcguire. Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right. West Hollywood feels like a bunny night. With Good company and better jewelers. To the Good Life, we Good music. [Big Sean]. Man, I wake up to a wet dream. Every day's a Friday and every nights a sex scene. Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean. Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings. I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens. My life's prom night and guess who's the Prom King. They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King. Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring. I'm Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter, Sean Combs and Connery all in one. Whoever told you sky's the limit is looking dumb. Cause I'm 22 and I'm moonwalking on the sun. Oh thats your girl?. She feelin on my water right next to a couple boaters. And she tryna motor boat her and im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor. You might find banana clips 'cause it's Guerilla warfare. Last year I was watching this from the couch and now I'm here. Thats to let you know what I'm about. Reaper black suit cuz my whole team's killin'. Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin'. Many tell me I'm the man I ain't made it yet. Tell me who the baddest, I'll see if I see them naked yet. Won't stop til I get that Mercedes 700 Clk and Mercedes ain't made it yet. [Cyhi Da Prince]. I'm Mr. Got Bread like Quizno's. Better known as Mj with the big nose. I swear your artist couldn't see me on his tip toes. Only on Tv I gotta take a quick pose. Let me stop I forgot this was a big show. If being dope made you broke I am piss poor. I'm big poppa plus I'm 2pacalypto. My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for?. Huh, I'm doing this for hip hop. I'm coming after you, him and his spot!. Still tied to the streets like a fish knot. Ain't nothing fake, I'm not a Rolly with a tick tock. Atlanta repper in the home of the yankee. Rose wood suit on with the hanky. I got rich from the zones of the stanky. So everybody know my money long, lanky!. So I'm flexible stretching out my decimals. Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles. Can't bleep it out cuz there wasn't nothing sexual. I'm blowing loud, somebody check the decibels. I'm impeccable they put me on the pedestal. And if you bite me, it's good for you like a vegetable. Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals. And if I ever do time than you know its federal. Uh, incredible, yeah. [Common]. F-f-f-fam fam fam I'ma monster too. You don't see I do things that the monsters do. The incomparable, remarkable, articles. About my audible technique, my technique. I recognize game like the Espy's. Cold to myself I say God Bless me the truth. So I speak live and directly. You, I will set free my mic is where my check be. Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro. Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough. The name is Common but the frame is special. Leave requested from the years I've invested. Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope. The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley. Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly. [Kanye West]. The plan was to drink till the pain over. What's worse, the pain or the hangover?. Fresh air rolling down the window. Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow. I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal. Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal. This game you could never win. Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again. Get away from me lonliness. Get away from me misery. Get away from me fake shit, I can't take the phoniness. Get away from me wack tracks. I can only make only hits. I'm an only child lost in the World. Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring. Feeling like hell rings. Bringing me back down. Checking my background. Its ironic whats happening. Imagine if I didn't have the ends. I would'nt have so many imaginary friends. I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk. Wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk. I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more. I stopped visitin around the time I was a sophomore. I guess everything I hate about me I see in him. And I ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again. Just a few things pouring out my soul. Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed",

I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em. And I ain't Bing Crosby to 'em…. More like… to 'em. Aye yo, I've got to ruin. The image and the style that you're used to doin'. When people usually do music. I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it. Before I lose it and have to prove it. This the way to prove it, this the way that we gon' do it. Time, we gotta move it to the future. Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya. Don't shoot… stop the violence, and it's been stopped. We stopped the violence in the hip-hop. We stopped the hatin' and the degradation. We 'bout to build like One Nation. Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson. Uh, that's the next president, arson. Burn it down, burn Hollwood, burn, like Ice Cube said. I'm the rudest…. A lot of people say that, 'cause they say \"'Ye, don't play that\". They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that 'Ye Juice. That's the way I stay loose. Confidence and esteem, American dream. My crib's spatial…. And my relationship is interracial. [Verse 2]. I don't know where to start…. I don't know where to start. Maybe the chart, maybe the heart. Maybe the flow… maybe the gold…. Where I was grown, what I grew up in. Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy. And moved my family when I was 3. And in the cold…. Straight from Chicago where I go. And everybody know…. From my homie Don C, I be air. Aye, yo - like IBM. Or Apple, Steve Jobs of this. Yeah, I'm on my job with this. Aye, yo, it's very, very simple. You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel. I can do it every tempo. I'll use my temple. I wanna build a temple. I wanna build churches. That could be as big as The Adam's Family's, where Lurch is. Aye, yo, this is not a circus. The zoo is closed, motherfuckers. Aye, yo…. It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect. And now you know it's still worth it. I might short-circuit, I might just black out. Hit you with that \"BLOCKA! \". You know I'm the blocka…. Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker. Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us. Because... God on my side. That's the way I ride. Jesus Christ…. Yeezus nice!. [Verse 3]. One time I had lost my faith. But I had to stay faithful and grateful. For the God I was given. The way that I was livin' or the life that I've been livin'. It didn't make a difference. See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents. Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather. Mother, father, now I've only got one parent. Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent. But still you've got to stay strong. I don't know what everybody else is on. Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out. Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now. And I doubt they even listen, and I ain't tryna diss 'em. But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison. And everybody say bein' a rockstar is everything. But see, I wanna do everything. And I know I could do everything. And be anything that I wanna be. So simply, if you wanna be like Mike, I wanna be like Christ. You know what I'm saying?. Okay, this beat just threw me off…. Took it extra old-school. This ain't no freestyle beat - yo, yo, dude!",

Yeah that's what we'll yell out (yell out),. You know the name do, i gotta spell out, or tell bout?. J.A.Y, and Ye' so shy, now he won't even step to his idol to say hi.. Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by,. Back of my mind, he could change your life.. With all these beats i did, atleast let him hear,. Atleast you can brag to your friends back at the gig.. But he got me out my mama' crib,. Then he helped me get my mama' a crib.. [CHORUS]. Big brother was BIG's brother,. Used to Be Dame and BIG's brother,. Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,. No I.D my mentor, Now Let the story begin (begin).. Let the story begin (let the story begin)..

Round the same time of that Blueprint One,. And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for im'.. I played my little songs in that old back room,. He'd bop his head and say, 'damn, oh thats you?'. But by the black album, i was blackin' out,. Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd.. Big brother got a show up in Madison Square,. And i'm like, 'Yeah yeah, we gon' be there!'. But, not only did i not get a chance to spit it.. Carlene told me i could buy two tickets.. I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different,. And kept little brother at bay at a distance.. But everything that i felt was more bogus,. Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent.. Only thing i wanna know, is why i get looked over,. I guess i understand when i get more older.. Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem,. Now im' on the top and everybody on the Scrotum.. [CHORUS]. My Big brother was B.I.G's brother,. Used to Be Dame and B.I.G's brother,. Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,. No I.D my mentor, now Let the story begin (begin).. Let the story begin.. If you feel the way i feel, why won't you wave your hands?. [VERSE 3]. Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?. Not only a client, but the presedito.. Hola' Hovito', the game gettin' foul, so here's a free throw.. I was always on the other side of the peep hole,. Then i dropped Jesus Walks, now im on a steeple.. And we know, New Jack City gotta keep my brother,. But to be number one, imma' beat my brother.. On that diamonds remix, i swore i'd spaz,. Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass!. Sibling rivalry, only i could see, it was the pride in me, that was drivin' me.. At the grammy's i said, i inspired me.. But my big brother who i always tried to be.. When i kicked the flow, it was like pick and roll',. Coz even if he gave me the ROC, it's give and go.. I guess being styled was more of a slam dunk,. And my **** was more like a finger roll, but i had them singles so,. And them hoe's at the show gonna' mingle yo, (laughs), ya'll know!. I told Jay i did a song with Coldplay,. Next thing i know, he got a song with coldplay.. Back of my mind, im like 'damn,no way',. Translate Espanyol, No way hose'!. Then i went and told Jay Brown,. Should have known that was gonna come back around,. Should have talked to you like a man, should have told you first,. But i told someone else and thats what made **** worse.. My big brother, was BIG's brother,. So here's a few words from ya kid brother.. If you admire somebody, you should go head and tell em',. People never get the flowers, while they can still smell em'.. A idol in my eyes, god of the game, heart of the city, Roc-a-fella Chain,. Never be the same, never be another number one Young Hov' or so my big brother.. [CHORUS]. My Big brother was B.I.G's brother,. Used to Be Dame and B.I.G's brother,.

When I die, bury me inside the Louis store. All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho. All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho. [Verse 1: 2 Chainz]. She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty. Scrr..Scrr.. Wrists moving, cookin' to it. I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere. Just made a juug, I got bands everywhere. You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath. Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt! hold his tech. Extendo clip, extendo roll. When your girl leave me she need a hair salon. Hair weave killer goin' on a trapathon. See I done had more bombs than Pakistan. Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb. See nigga, I'm ballin', you in will call. When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store. When I die, bury me inside the Truey store. True to my religion, 2 everything I'm too different. So when I die, bury me next to 2 bitches. [Hook].

You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T.V. on. Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage. 'Specially if you put that BMW in the garage. 'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib. Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids. Last birthday, she got you a new sweater. Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, \"Do better\". She said, \"How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?\". How 'bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend?. I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her. Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice. Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit. We in Kanye West's Benz.

You in first place, you in first place. Bad bitches contest, you in first place. I show up with a check to your work place. (Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces). Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on. (What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on). They ask me what I do and who I do it for. When I die, bury me inside the booty club. Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl. I might switch it up and get you girl. [Hook]. [Outro: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]. Deuce and Ye. We like Snoop and Dre. Isn't this your birthday, baby?. You deserve a coupe today. (You in first place, you in first place). (Bad bitches contest you in first place!",

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it. Stick around, some real feelings might surface. Been a long time since I spoke to you. In a bathroom gripping you up, fucking and choking you. What the hell was I supposed to do?. I know you ain't getting in this type of dick from that local dude. And if you are, I hope you have a good time. Cause I definitely be having mine. And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional. Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you. Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there, consoling you. Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?. You should be grateful, a nigga like me ever noticed you. Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you. 1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you. I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do. Even though I knew, he never told the truth. He was just go say whatever that you told him to. At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions. Chuck on dirt on each other like mud wrestlers. I heard he bought some coke with my money. That ain't right, girl. You getting blackmailed for that white girl. You always said: Yeezy, I ain't you're right girl. You'll probably find one of them \"I like art\" type girls. All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl. And I was satisfied being in love with a lie. Now, who to blame? You to blame, me to blame. For the pain and it poured everytime when it rained. [John Legend]. Let's play the blame game, I love you more. Let's play the blame game for sure. [Kanye West]. Things used to be, now they not. Anything but us is who we are. Disguising ourselves as secret lovers. We've become public enemies. We walk away like strangers in the street. Gone for eternity, we erased one another. So far from where we came. With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?. Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of el, o, vee, e. Hatred and attitude tear us entirely. Chloe Mitchell. [John Legend]. Let's play the blame game, I love you more. Let's play the blame game for sure. Let's call out names, names, I hate you more. Let's call out names, names, for sure. I can't love you this much [5x]. No, I can't love you this much. I can't love you this much [2x]. [Kanye West]. And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing. And when the phone called, it just rang and rang. You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back. And I heard the whole thing. I heard the whole thing (the whole thing [3x]). [Chris Rock]. Oh, my God!. Baby, you done took this shit to the another motherfucking level. Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this. Goddamn, goddamn! Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?. -Yeezy taught me. You never used to talk dirty, but now yo-you're goddamn disgusting!. My, my God, wh-where, where did you learn that?. -Yeezy taught me. Look at you motherfucking but-ass naked. With them mothefuckin' Jimmy Choos on. Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?. -Yeezy taught me. Yo, you took your pussy game up a whole another level. This is some Cirque 'u Soleil pussy now! Shit. You done went all porno on a nigga, ok?. And I, I, I, I, I love it and I thank you, I thank you. My dick thanks you!. How'd you learn? How'd, how did you pussy game come up?. -Yeezy taught me. I was fucking parts of your pussy I never fucked before. I was in there like: oh, shit, I never been here before. I've never even seen this part of pussy town before. It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?. Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?. -Yeezy reupholstered my pussy. You know what? I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him. I'ma buy that album, I'ma download that mothefucker. I'ma shoot a bootlegger!. That's how good I feel about this nigga. Oh! I still can't believe you got me this watch. This mothefucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!. Even with the bezel! This is the mothefucker I wanted. I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source. I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source. That's right, that's right!. Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this is the best birthday ever!. Where you learnt to treat a nigga like this?. -Yeezy taught me. Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well!",

And I'm holdin' down the summer now. And all I want is what I can't buy now. Cause I ain't got the money on me right now. And I told you to wait. Yeah I told you to wait. So I'mma need a little more time now. Cause I ain't got the money on me right now. And I thought you could wait. Yeah and I thought you could wait. These bitches surroundin' me. All want somethin' out me. Then they talk about me. Would be lost without me. We could've been somebody. Thought you'd be different 'bout it. Now I know you naughty. So let's get on with it. [Hook 1]. You could've been somebody. 'Stead you had to tell somebody. Let's take it back to the first party. When you tried your first molly. It came out of your body. It came out of your body. Running naked down the lobby. And you was screamin' that you love me. Before the limelight tore yah. Before the love life stole yah. Remember we were so young. When I would hold you. Before the glory. I know there ain't wrong with me. [Bridge]. Something strange is happening. [Hook 2]. You could've been somethin'. We could've ugh, we could've been somebody. Or was it all our first party. When we tried our first molly. And came out of our body. And came out of our body. [Verse 2]. Before they call lawyers. Before you tried to destroy us. How you gon' lie to the lawyers?. It's like I don't even know yah. I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my. [Verse 3]. To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby. Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy. I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z. He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy. She Instagram herself like \"Bad bitch alert\". He Instagram his watch like \"Mad rich alert\". He only wanna see that ass in reverse. Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse. Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side. Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid. Then she said she impregnated. That's the night your heart died. Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that. Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that. Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that. All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that. That going to that owing money that the court got. On and on that alimony. Yeah, yeah she got you homey. 'Til death but do your part. Unholy matrimony",

Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling. Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven. We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors. Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors. Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue. Grants, Jacksons no room for George. Yeh, the Fear of God's in you muthafuckers. This art imitate my life. You Worldstarhiphop fame based off imitation hype. Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice. My music for your soul, inspiration for your life. Every dime made in his life more disastrous. Help my new bitch see her way through her Bachelor's. Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters. Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters. The truth hurts everytime it's revealed. What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel. Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park. Kentucky derby on the grill. The fact that I'm free lets me know God is great. Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate. These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear. Villian like candyman, say my name and I'll appear. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java. Strolling up the totem poll, what's my only problem. Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler. So many hands raised as the band plays. I'm here now, watch how many nigga's plans change. [Kanye West]. Penitentiary chances, the devil dances. And eventually answers to the call of Autumn. All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'. Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin. Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums. Based off the way we was branded. Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon. And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random. But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage. I need a happy ending and a new beginning. And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative. And sold your dreams, you don't know who did it. I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids. I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it. I need more drinks and more lights. Hot American Apparal girl in just tights. She told the director she tryna get in a school. Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool. It's been a while since I watched the tube. Its like a crip said: \"I got way too many blues for any more bad news\". I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today. They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday. What's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach. I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach. But God said I need a different approach. Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke. It ain't funny anymore try dipping jokes. Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o. Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it. Play strings for the dramatic. And end all of that wack shh. Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes. I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it. I'm coming after whoever who has it. You blowing up, that's good, fantastic. That y'all, its like that ya'll. I don't really give a fuck about it at all. Cause the same people that tried to black ball me. Forgot about 2 things, my black balls. [Pusha T]. Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me. The making of this man, I let you see the higher me. The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy. I'm drawing from both sides, I'm Siamese. The tug of war opens the door, entrada. Rip me apart and see what's inside this pinata. And rolling kilos in gym(?) is one saga. One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter. Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women whom. Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom. And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome. But adios I blow my own dice before I toss 'em, loss 'em. Some other muthafuckers double crossed 'em. Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune. Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen. Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo. As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih. Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with. Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss. But the devil red, tires double tread. I'm posting parks up. that gets me double head. Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head. The bright lights blind look what the devil did. Yeah. [Kanye West]. It's hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion. The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing. This is more than just my road to redemption. Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention. As long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me. But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me. I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me. If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet. But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus. Ready for the Worl's game, this is my Olympics. We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish. Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick. And I assisted to get up offa this dick. And these drugs, fans can't resist it. Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted. If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!",

Seemed like I just wasn't reaching the charts. 5000 hours, rewritting Power. Over and over. Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual. So unusual to be in this position. Everything I say everybody tryna diss 'em. Everybody playin him, truth be told. The last nigga ever let the truth be told. And oh Mos Def ran to my home. And said they gon have yo ass gone. Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks. Can't even take the piss. They gon' test your urine. Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!. \"Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?\". I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola). Say 'he ain't clean enough'. But rappers ain't mean enough?. Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough. On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till. Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed. Lets keep this shit real!. Now who the realest. Everybody feel this. And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites. Cause I said what's right. I go to sleep and deal wit it every night. And wake up every morning. And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa wats worser?. Its no verse that would reverse the-. In print or in cursive. They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane. Let's have a 'toast for the douche bags'. Black people wanna talk about me on blogs. Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'. Thats what I have to deal wit real shit. Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man. A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin' my part. All this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't 'Jesus Walks'. For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears. They playin' wit niggas careers. Felt like I'm the only real nigga here. From my last breath. They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left. Then they even set Beyonce up to give the Award back. Didn't even know I afford that. And she rode the wave as I rode the slave. As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave. Nigga behave, nigga behave. Be the first ?. I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin' and stay frontin'. And get up and just perform, Shit is enormous. Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit 'bout. My whole family, now I'm scared of Grammy's. Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history. So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded. Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be in more debt. Uh, it's too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas. How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand. Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya. [Mos Def]. No matter what goes on. They may not agree, they may not understand. But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand. And his hand and that hand. And ideas, and all of theres. And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere. So make it clear, live long and prosper. Much success, even if you wish me the opposite. To quote Nas, I stay on my job. Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm. And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me. My life is real even when I'm in the movies. I'm on the ave, I'm in the cave. I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago. My life is real, as it ever been. To all my friends and even foes. Each and every one of those, let em know. I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart. Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position. Feel blessed to make the whole World listen. And just glisten without even trying. Even when I die, I won't stay dead. And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs. Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young. And I'm straight from the slums. And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum?. This thing ups, let us all give some. Number one yo, I'm number none, no comparision. And make the whole world aware of it. Brooklyn in the building we take care of it. Peace out to all the Sagittarius. And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too. And this go out to all area crew. And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me. Say it over ?. From the present, and the past and the future and beyond. Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on",

Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team. You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match. I got the gat ratching new cases to catch. I got my business manager erasing my debt. I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit. I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it. My girl come over try to help me shine. How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine. But everytime I get a check you be first up in line. Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying. You better grow up before I blow up. Have weed rolled up when I show up. Matter fact we broke as fuck. Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up. Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend. So I promise to never pick up smutts. In my Cadillac pick-up truck. They need to get they sit-ups up. They always be colder than you. A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you. Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels. That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college.

No styles just good times like they're so nuts. We always thought if we had dough we could do so much. Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch. Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon. We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room. We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom. That I call my lair. We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz. But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend.

And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits. They don't want to turn they speakers up. they claim I ain't deep enough. All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up. I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters. Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to \"Heat\" it up. I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front. I make history e'ry day - I don't need a month. The survey says - by the streets according. Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan. Was to the NBA when he was scorin'.

While you givin' me \"Head\" like shampoo. come as you came. Skip the brand name - I won't brand you. What you do here'll stay here like Cancun. Besides your breasts is augmented - I like things authentic. Look at all my whips, they're all vintage. I got a loft with a view of the sea. See I take some more shit and make it new for me. Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree. Why spend and arm and a leg. we can kick it for free you see. [Hook: Rhymefest] x2. I don't like it unless it's (brand new).

Like \"Wait - you basically suck\" - his mother said. \"My son wanna rhyme! \". I'm like \"Ma'am - I don't agree with that decision. Nothin' against him - but if he step I got to diss him.

[Verse 1: Kanye West]. Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap. I got to ´pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably). But is it cool to rap about gold. If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!). First nigga with a Benz and a backpack. Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack. Always said if I rapped I´d say somethin´ significant. But now I´m rappin´ ´bout money, hoes, and rims again. And it´s still about the Benjamins. Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms. Strippers named Cinnamon. More chips than Pentium. What´cha gon´ buy next? Whatever new trend it is. I´m tryin´ to spend my stacks. And I´m so broke I look back like \"Damn, was I on crack?\". I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?. What the hell was wrong with me dog?.

Heard her man was the boss of the floss. But she still want to toss me the drawers. And it ain´t gon´ cost me because she my caddy. Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club. And I´m still actin´ calm than a mug. She asked \"Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?\". While we drive she tellin´ me ´bout problems with her man. Baby I fully understand. Let me help you with a plan. While he trickin´ off, don´t get no rich nigga. Give ME some head, that´ll really piss hI´m off. [inhales]. [Hook: Ludacris]. Yeah, breathe in, breathe out.

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E´s out. When I pull a piece out niggas like \"Peace out!\". [Verse 3: Kanye West]. I blow past low class niggas with no cash. In the fo´ dash six, bitch you can go ask. So when I go fast popo just laugh. Right until I run out of gas or ´til I go crash. Whatever comes first I´m prepared for the worst. Whatever comes second I´ll be there with my weapon. Pullin´ up in the Lexuses/´lexeses, one on both hand. So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous. Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin´ me messages. \"K I need a free hand mammogram. I got weed, drink, and a Handicam. All of which is legal in Amsterdam\". So say my name like Candyman. And I´ma come and fix you up like the handyman. But if you don´t need a fix, girl you gotta leave. You can´t take that all at one time ya gotta breathe. [Hook: Ludacris].

And get some lee way on the he say she say. You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay. Spanish girls say \"No able ingle\". And everybody want to run to me for their SINGLE. It's funny how these wack niggaz need my help. Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself. Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself. Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself. Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself. And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help. Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin. Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin.

Make a phone call, out to Joan Smalls. I wonder how it feel to lower (Lara) Stone's walls. Jessica Gomes, yall, I would damage her. And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina. I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve. I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg. Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa. Alessandra Ambrosia, Anja Rubik,. get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single.

He ain't Kraft material, champagne for cereal. Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm. Fly clothes and Lear shows, type kind of stuff we on. Stuff all my problems in that bong and I'm puffin' strong. I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone. Must've been the liquor talkin', I'm beggin' the cups, ?C'mon?. Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form. T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler's poem. My sound's full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush). Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Uh). N-gga, make some money ?fore you make a comment. I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?. Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy. Now I'm back like a nine milli, runnin' New York City. See me clearly through the storm. The world's mine, sits pretty in my palm. Sean Don (Chandon?) as we continue on. [John Legend - Chorus].

I keep calling. why I keep calling you. [Kid Cudi]. Niggas think they know I'm the guy with the story. they dont really know what's in my head, fuckin' with me. How can I be better?. I could start with just the basics. Dior, Dior, galore, I love the cut. I seem to have forgotten that I'm off the nini. to the people who dont know Cud', know what?. rose gold presidential on my boney wrist. took my ma to Chanel, had her LC the stunner. she got haters, some in the fam made us. but they don't really matter, we escaping with our paper. ?Hey ya?, I'm on my Andre 3000. I'm all good now, a nigga don't need no counseling. woke up in the room and my mojo was active. looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive. back when let me not reflect on the old shit. I'm on to the new act, on to my new script. Bitches better have they thoughts before approaching. I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas. do things all before living, haters, copy, I'm the image. haters, copy, I'm the image",

Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill. And we wipin' snow up off the windshield. It's still, wonderful night to be alive, baby. And I'm so happy I'm with my baby. And we a li'l late wit' the Christmas gifts. Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy. The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially. Told her that \"You the star at the top of my Christmas tree\". My only question is, \"Where my presents?\". She said, \"Shhh,\" she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see. Well, I like the way you think, mami. Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami. Got a surprise for you that ain't on your Christmas list-es. Gave her the hot chocolate, she said \"It's D-ricious\". Christmas in Harlem. Right after autumn falls. Soakin' it all in. Then we gon' hit the mall. (I'm like Bad Santa, though). Even though we ain't ballin'. (You might have to sit on my lap). Feel like we bought it all. (Ho, ho, ho). The mistletoe's right here. Come give a kiss to Santa Claus. (Cyhi the Prince:). First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y'all. For Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs. I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph. Thugs think I'm a Blood 'cause I won't take this red suit off. Ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe. I let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the North Pole. Her voice slow 'cause \"I always got a sore throat\". Okay, stop it, no more jokes. You never see me 'cause I shop when the stores close. And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go. Ha, I got nine reindeers. That's Dancer, that's Prancer on the fourth flo'. That's Comet, that's Cupid, that's Vixen. That's Donner, that's Dasher, that's Blitzen. Happy Kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren't Christian. Everybody gets gifts as long as I'm livin'. So look forward to havin'. Christmas in Harlem. Right after autumn falls. Soakin' it all in. Then we gon' hit the mall. Even though we ain't ballin'. Feel like we bought it all. The mistletoe's right here. Come give a kiss to Santa Claus. All the flashin' lights up on a tree. The house lit up ni-ice. Wit' your family's where you wanna be. Here on Christmas night. When you wake up and you see the gifts. Don't that make you feel go-ood?. So since we all snowed in in Harlem. Let's have Christmas in the hoo-hood. All of the flashin' light. Yeah, when they shine so bright. Always for you and me. Baby, you're Christmas Eve. If you like what you see. Won't you come sit on my knee?. Tell me everything that you want",

And they still want to know when the album comin’ out. Ask the teenagers, O’Gs and Ask the kids. What they definition of Classic is. Timeless, cause age don’t count in the booth. And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth. And no doubt the truth I’m off the meters. Everybody co-signing even non-believers. I came in the door, became one of y’alls leaders. In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers. Uptown we call ‘em uppies when they on divas. Prolly worn when KRS One teaches. Nas, made you look, before the haters. I bet you Kan had ‘em on when he walked with Jesus. This is classic. classic, better than I'v ever been. talent,. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. Classic. Better than I'v ever been. [Kanye West:]. Can’t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness. It’s performin’, look how long the line is. That’s what happens when you make shit that’s timeless. That’s what happens these rappers is the pioneers. What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?. That’s so novice, I’m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish. I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base. To let me figure out this wasn’t my place, the beat slowed til’ you listened to my pace. Cuz I be killin’ shit, but that’s evident, and y’all feelin’ it, but I expected it. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. classic, better than I'v ever been. talent,. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. Classic. Better than I'v ever been. [Nas:]. Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this. O you went platinum – yeah that’s nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice. New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time. It’s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man. Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans. When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain’t right, by the time you could afford it the car ain’t important. In the streets silent, it’s just I and - cops keep firin’ in my environment. Leavin’ your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on. I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong. I’m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that’s what I’m accustomed to. classic, better than I'v ever been. talent,. If it’s classic it’s gonna last forever than I’m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been. Classic. Better than I'v ever been. [KRS One:]. How many y’all got criminal minded you you you y’all don’t be blinded. Me I got no jewels on my neck, why – I don’t need ‘em I got your respect. KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock – this hip hop. And we’s a nation, don’t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?. Instead of broadcasting how we smokin’ trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC’s. Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC’ing and rap. Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC’s spit rhymes to uplift they people. Peace, love, unity, and Havin’ fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One",

I'm talking George Tenet. I seen him the other day. He asked me about my Maybach. Think he had the same. Except mine tinted and his might have been rented. You know white people get money don't spend it. Or maybe they get money, buy a business. I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig'nant. I know Spike Lee gon kill me but let me finish. Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits. Them gold master p ceilings was just a figment. Of our imagination, Mtv cribs. Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where Tc lives. That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse. He wasn't really drunk he just had a few brews. Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage. Everything I do need a news crew present. Steve-O swerve homie, watch out for the waves. I'm way too black to burn from sunrays. So I just meditated the home in Pompay. About how I could build a new Rome in one day. Every time I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis. But I just wanna design hotels and nail it. Shit is real got me feelin' Isrealian. Like Bar Refaeli Gisele, no thats Brazilian. Went through deep depression when my momma passed. Suicide what kind of talk is that. But I've been talking to God for so long. That I have you look in my life I guess he talking back.

[Kanye West - Verse 1]. may the Lord forgive us. may the God’s be with us. and that magic hour I seen good christians make rash decisions. oh she do it, what happened to Religion?. oh she lose it. she putting on her make up. she casually allure. text message break up, the casualty of tour. how she gone wake up and not love me no more. I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it’s rubbing off. hood phenomenom, the Lebron of rhyme. hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron. I’m looking at her like “this what you really want it, huh?”. what we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime. [Chorus]. (satan, satan, satan). [Kanye West - Verse 2]. When the sun go down its the magic hour. the magic hour. and outta all the colours that are still up the skies. you got green on your mind. I can see it in your eyes. why you standing there with your face screwed up. don’t leave while your hot that’s how Mase screwed up. throwing sh-t around, the whole place screwed up. maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us. I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat. I ordered you jerk, she said “you are what you eat”. you see I always loved your sense of humour. but tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was. the Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme thats Dior Homme not Dior homie. the crib scarface couldn’t be more Tony. you love me for me could you be more phoney. [Chorus]. Uh put your hands to the constellations. they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation. haven’t said a word, haven’t said a word. to me this evening. Cat got your tongue?. [Rick Ross - Verse 3]. Lookin’ at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone. Lookin’ at my wrist it’ll turn your ass to stone. Stretch limousine, sippin’ Rosé all along. Double-headed monster with a mind of his own. Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character. All black tux, nigga the shoes lavender. I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders. Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired. Before his jaw shattered climbin’ up the Lord’s ladder. We still speedin’ runnin’ signs like they don’t matter. Uh, hater talkin’ never made me mad. Never that when I’m in my favorite papertag. Therefore G4s at the Clearport. When it come to tools fool I’m a Pep Boy. When it came to dope I was quick to export. Never tired of ballin’ so it’s on to the next sport. New Mercedes sedan, they’ll export. So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud. Different traps, I was gettin’ mail from. Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne. Whole clique’s appetite had tapeworms. Spinnin’ Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns. I shed a tear before the nights over. God bless the man I put this ice over. Gettin’ 2Pac money twice over. Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller. I’m makin’ love to the angel of death. Catchin’ feelings never stumble retracin’ my steps. [End]. . Almerizio Neto",

Ever, ever? Ever, ever?....... Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic. Vegas on acid,. Seen through these St. Laurent glasses. And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz. It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does. These writers don't rhyme, so sort of. I think 'em. That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up. Damn, is he really that caught up?. I ask if you talkin' bout glasses, do my name get brought up?. I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder. so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche. - its for yourself that's important. If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men. Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan. Excuse me,. That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because.

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?....... I was sick about awards. Couldn't nobody cure me. Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry. Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them. 30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them. What more can you ask for?. The international awards? nah. Who complains about when he is old?. And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old. You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul. And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,. When he came, in the game, he made his own name. Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name. Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kayne. Got family and a deacon, folk from Motown. Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown. Life movin' too fast I need to slow down. Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). My father Ben said I need Jesus. So he took me to church and let the water wash over my season. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). The preacher said we need leaders. Right then my body got still like a paraplegic. You know who you can call you gotta best believe it. The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it. Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic. Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic. After debris settles and the dust get swept off. Big K pick up where young Hov left off. Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off. I dropped my new shit sound like the best of. A&R's lookin' like \"pssh we messed up\". Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up. Bottle after bottle till we got messed up. In the studio, where really though, yea he next up. People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back. That'll be the day I give the game back. You know the next question dog \"Yo, where Dame at?\". This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back. \"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?\". They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen. R-r-r-right here stands a-man. With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands.... Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever). The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.. Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?....... Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)",

People lose hands, legs, arms for real. Little was known of Sierra Leone. And how it connect to the diamonds we own. When I speak of Diamonds in this song. I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glown. I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain. These ain't conflict diamonds,is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne. See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',. How? when I know of the blood diamonds. Though it's thousands of miles away. Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today. Over here, its a drug trade, we die from drugs. Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs. The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses. I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless. 'til I seen a picture of a shorty armless. And here's the conflict. It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold. Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice. On a polar rugby it look so nice. How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?. 'fore I beat myself up like Ike. You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. [Kanye]. People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh).

'wassup wit you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man?'. [Jay-Z]. Yep!. I got it from her 'ye damn!. The chain remians, the gang is in tact. The name is mine, I'll take blame for that. The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? (laughs). Part of me I had to laugh at that. How could you falter when you're the rock of gibralter. I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water. This ain't no tour order, this is nothin to me. Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week. I do this in my sleep,. I sell Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's. I'm not a buisness man I'm a buisness, man. Let me handle my buisness, damn!. Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy. YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me. Bleek could be one hit away his whole career. As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire. And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere. So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah. He don't even have to write rhymes. The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes. Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly. What I was sayin practically me whole carreer. The diamond is forever, I been mindin' this forever. Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better. People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'. Instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix. If you watin for the end, the dynasty signed. And what seemed like forever is a mighty long time. I'm young bitches [laughs]. Goodnight!",

My homey Mali used to stay one 79th and May. One of my best friends from back in the day. Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones. He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone. Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off. Walk around the mall with his radio face off. Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand. Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man. Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's. Drove by the teachers even more by police's. How he get that cash today his father passed away. Left him with a little somthin 16 he was stuntin. Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy. Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy. Hit the freeway go at least bout 80. Boned so much that summer even had him a baby. See back back then then if you had a car. You were the Chi town version of Baby. And I was just a virgin a baby. One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy. I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked. Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cracked. We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall. They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all. And there was a lot of flirting involved. But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws. So put me on with these hoes homey's. He said don't rush to get grown drive slow homey. Drive slow homie. Drive slow.... Ya never know homey about these hoes homey. Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey. [Paul Wall:]. What It do. I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'. The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing. Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac. Trunnk open screens on neons lit with --. I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies. Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes. It's a star-studded event when I valet park. Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark. You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin. The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin. I'm leanin on a switch sittin crooked in my slab. But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab. A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla. Riding some candy coated crawlin like a caterlippar. I'm tippin on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw. I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do?. [Chorus:]. Drive slow homey. Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes. Drive slow homey. If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go. Drive slow homey. Live today cuz tomorrow you never know. Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey. Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey. [Kanye:]. My cars like the movies my cars like the crib. I got more TV's in here then where I live. [GLC:]. And it don't make no sense but bay I'm the shit. And everything I flip you know is something serious. I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims. I got the baller genetics baby that's evident. You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced. That you should go and kiss it just a little bit. I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain. My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings. They see me hoes acting like they seen a king. With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green. My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues. My cylinder quiet like tip toes. I sold O's and this I know. When you see them hoes little homey drive slow. Chopped and Screwed. Yeah... Drive slow homey. Drive slow homey.

The Hot Spitter, and I don't give a fuck what you think. I got more ice than a super-size drink, holla back nigga. [Chorus - 2x]. (*talking*). Curren, Hot Spitter ya dig.

Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?. (all, all, all the glitter in that gold). Yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality). (real is what you live to be). [Verse 1: Kanye West]. This is family business. And this is for the family that can't be with us. And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us. That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet. Like a photo of your granny's picture. Now that you're gone it hit us. Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right. Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be light. Somebody please say grace so I can save face. And have a reason to cover my face. I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it. Pumpkin bread on the side, know how the family do it. When I brought it why did God have to look all to it?. As kids we used to laugh. Who knew that life would move this fast?. Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?. And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it. And if you did, then that's family business. [Hook: Choir]. And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things). All these fancy things. I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for. Now all I know I know all these things. [Verse 2: Kanye West]. This is family business. And this is for everybody standin' with us. Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture. Hey B, remember when they ain't believe in me?. Now she like \"See, that's my cousin on TV\". Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it. And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite. I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider. But when we get together be electric slidin'. Grandma, get 'em shook up. Aw naw, don't open the photo book up. I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name. But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane. You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude. But every holiday nobody eatin' her food. And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins. Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins. Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins. Fit three in the bed while six of y'all. I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg. But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed. [Interlude: Choir]. Rain, rain, rain go away. Let the sun come out and all the children say. Rain, rain, rain go away. Let the sun come out and all the children say. [Verse 3: Kanye West]. I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind. A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns. Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God. And keep your face to the risin' sun. All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog. And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog. I feel like one day you'll understand me dog. You can still love your man and be manly dog. You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'. Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman. Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?. The second he storm out then she storm in. Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion. And drink some wine like Communion. And act like everything fine and if it isn't. We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business. [Interlude: Choir]. (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things). They don't mean a thing. (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing, a thing. [Hook: Choir]. And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings). They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things). All these fancy things. I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for. Now all I know I know all these things. Females: (oooh) All these things (these things). Males: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things). F: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things). M: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things). F: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things). M: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things). F: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things).

                  "Lyric": "[Intro: Jay-Z (Kanye)]. [laughing]. Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker. Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room. 'Cause they don't fucking... (I'd like to propose a toast). (I said toast motherfucker). [Chorus: Kanye]. And I am. And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them. Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky. This is the last call for alcohol, for the... So get your ass up off the wall. [Verse 1]. The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac. The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc. I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame. And come back next year with the whole fucking game. Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top. They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop. Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself. Rocafella's only niggaz that help. My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair. Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here. They say he bourgie, he big-headed. Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is. Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds. I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas. It's funny how wasn't nobody interested. 'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus. [Chorus]. [Verse 2]. Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir. Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir. Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest. But all they got left is this guy called West. Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def. Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z. I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh. It come out sweeter than old Sadie. Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards. Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards. And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye. I'm almost reignin'. Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?. It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him. Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine. Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme. Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem. Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams. I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed. But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh. So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more. You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more. You can't say shit to Kanye West no more. I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga. I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don. Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom. I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards. I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars. I went to the malls and I balled too hard. 'Oh my god, is that a black card?'. I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term. African American Express. Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell. Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to. Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips. [Chorus]. \"... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz\". [Outro]. So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop. picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin?\". I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\". Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone. going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats. And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers. cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with. And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"look man, you wanna mess with Kanye. you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\". [No ID:] \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\". I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not. but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer. [Hiphop:] \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\",. I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production. But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know. After they picked that Truth beat. I was figuring I was gonna do some more work. But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago. I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts. just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy. get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something. or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then. I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample. I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like \"oh, yo that shit is crazy. Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.\". And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me. so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like. with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style. when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'. And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album. I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound. You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time. I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with. Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm. sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did. for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he. gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I. came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, \"oh. you a real soulful dude\" [Jay-Z: \"you a real soulful dude\"]. And he. uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got. to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said. [Jay-Z:] \"check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\". \"tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking. like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't. want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my. personal opinion. So he asked me, \"what you think of it?\". [Jay-Z:] \"so what you thinkin?\". And I was like, \"man that shit tite,\". you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train. man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just. in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got. acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like. poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one. of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through. my production company, but he ended up going straight with the. company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad. news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at. the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took. that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about. ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal. with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to. [Mother:] \"Come on, let's just go\". Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.. I remember I pulled up. [Mother:] \"Kanye, baby, we're here\",. I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a. bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and. the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'. And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up. there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I. played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone. he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at. that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket. hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said. \"yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And. really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.. [Hiphop:] \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\".. And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that. GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of. them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen. Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like \"yo what's up I'm Kanye.\". [Dame:] \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\". \"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?. Yo, this nigga got classics\". [Dame:] \"Jay got classics, G.\". You know I ain't talkin shit.. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm. still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show. The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my. eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all. these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one. thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be. Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton. sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John. Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the. time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I. spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical. shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his. eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap. was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.. He said \"man that was tite.\". [Jay-Z:] \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\". That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.. Okay, fast forward.. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just. took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship. with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my. career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me. to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at. this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had. relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so. they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound. like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them. these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll. be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy. 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they. didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked. with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the. company that'll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my. nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man. [Jessica:] \"Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\". I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up. \"Y'all niggaz is stupid\". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.. The nigga that was behind me, I mean,. he wasn't even a nigga, you know?. The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol. Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.. [Joe:] \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\". Dame was like, \"yo you got a deal with Capitol,. okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\". [Dame:] \"you gotta make sure it's not wack.\". Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to. play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and. Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll. never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'. \"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow. I got eleven plaques on my walls right now. You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\". Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So. I play that song for him, and he's like \"oh shit\". [Dame:] \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\". \"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\". [Dame:] \"it's actually kinda hot.\". Like they still weren't looking at me. like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole. album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and. save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's. like \"yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick\". [Dame:] \"you don't wanna catch a brick\". You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with. that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was. already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you. know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I. was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm. not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer. rapper\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--. the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio. sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes. man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said. \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\". [Mel:] \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\". And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested. and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying. to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I. called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?\"",

Now I'm good bitch. I ain't no Kennedy. But I'm hood rich. So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto. And everybody else, thank you very little. I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path. I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past. It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last. Ain't nothin' free from that point, though. We needed cash. And we need it fast. We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last. Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white. 'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white.

How I left Chicago. How I'm the only one eatin'. Shut your pie hole. And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though. Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro. When you prepare, would you copy what I do and say?. Only difference between you and me, you were gay. Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?. Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt. I've lived. Yes I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each, and every highway. What more, and what's more than this -. It go my way, Chi-Way. This way or the highway. When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways. I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way. Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on T.V.. And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway. Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay. We stay 4 stars, or better. 'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather. And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better. And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas. You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial. Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's. Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg. Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg. 40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg. So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off. I've lived.

Making sense of it we hustle for change. Revolution ain't a game. It's another name. For life fighting. Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson. Hypes fighting for hits to heighten they hell.

Horse got me trapped like r. kel', I bail and it-. Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again. I'm on my way home. I left three days ago. But no one seems to know I'm gone.

Get up, I get.... Get up, I get.... Get up, I get down. [Jay-Z]. Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts. First I had they ear, now I have their heart. Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start. I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart. Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons. I seen them re-po'd, re-sold then re-driven. So when I reload, he holds #1 position. When you hot I'm hot. And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin. It's plain to see, niggaz can't fuck with me. Cuz I'm a be that nigga for life. This is not an image, this is God given. This is hard livin, mixed with crystall sippin. It's the most consistent, Hov. Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and. Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin. It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap. I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy. [Chorus overlapping last four lines]. [Kanye West]. I get down for my grandfather who took my momma. Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat. At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in. And with that in my blood I was born to be different. Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership. But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership. Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin it. Racisms still alive, they just be concealin it. But I know they don't want me in the damn club. They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club. I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed. Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times. But in the land where niggaz praise Yukons and getting paid. Its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved. Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves. Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away. So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter. And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up. And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her. You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up. But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye. Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye. First Aaliyah now romeo must die?. I know I got angels watchin me from the other side. [Chorus]. [J.Ivy]. We are all here for a reason on a particular path. You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math. Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious. That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world. I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls. I'm not just another individual. My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual. But I get my hymns from him. So it's not me it's he that's lyrical. I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument. My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes. For your soul and your mental. That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into. Yeah I need my loot by rent day. But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte. I'm tryna give us us free like Sinke. I can't stop, that's why I'm hot. Determination, dedication, motivation. I'm talking to you of my many inspirations. When I say I can't let you or self down. If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff. And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life. In my grip I would never ever let you down. And when these words are found. Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed. With a language called love. That's why my breath is felt by the death. And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind. I too dream in color and in rhyme. So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house. Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth. A touch of god reigns out. [Chorus]. [Jay-Z]. Who else you know been hot this long. Started from nothing but he got this strong. Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you. Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special. Let you tell it man I'm fallin well. Somebody must have caught hi'm cuz. Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan em. Number one albums what I got, like four of em. More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way. Clear the way, I'm here to stay. Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that. This is Jay, dissin Jay will get you Mase'd. When I start spittin them lyrics niggaz get very religious. Six hail mary's please father forgive us. Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggaz. They way y'all all follow Jigga. Hov's a livin legend and I'll tell you why. Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive",

I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know. I'm living 3 dreams, Biggie Smalls, Dr. King, Rodney Kings. Uh, cause we can't get along, no resolution. Till we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston. Cars, money, girls and the clothes. Aww man, you sold your soul. Nah man, mad people was frontin'. Aww man, made something from nothing. Picture working so hard and you cant cut through. That can mess up your whole life, like the uncle that touched you. What has the world come to?. I'm from the. 312, where cops don't come through, and dreams don't come true. Like where did God go, in his Murcielago. From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note. He even got enough to get his mama a condo. Than they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom. 40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week. Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street. Welcome to Sunday service if you hope that Sunday service. We got green in my eyes, follow this Eric Sermon. Did Moses not part the water with the cane. Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain. Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame. Ran to Jacob's and made the new Jesus Chains. In Jesus name, let the choir say. I'm on fire ayy, that's what Richard Pryor Say. And we annihilate anybody that violate. Ask any dopeboy you know, they admire Ye'. GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music. And all my niggas say GOOD Music. And all my ladies say GOOD Music. I don't know but I've been told. I don't know but I've been told.

Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag. Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?. That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck. She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper. I said baby, spin that round. and say the alphabet backwards. You're dealing with malpractice. don't kill a good nigga's confidence. Just cause he a nerd. and you don't know what a condom is. The head still good though, the head still good though. Make me say \"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\". Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical. Make me get spiritual. Make me believe in miracles. Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal. Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me. Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday. Bottle service, head service, I came in first place. The opportunity, the proper top of breast. and booty cheek. The pop community. I mean these bitches come with union fee. And I want two of these. moving units through consumer streets. Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity. And yeah G, I was all for it. She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet. I'mma put you on game for the lames. that don't know they're a rookie. Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy. [Hook: Kanye West]. Scary. Scary. No more parties in L. A. Please, baby, no more parties in L. A. [Verse 2: Kanye West]. Friday night tryna make it into the city. Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty. Thinking back to how I got here in the first place. Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base. A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds. And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only get hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir. Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use they kids as meal tickets. Not knowing the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can't fault 'em really. I remember Amber told my boy. no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly. Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'. Of weak content and slow jammin'. But don't worry, this one's so jammin'. You know it, L. A. , it's so jammin'. I be thinkin' every day. Mulholland Drive. need to put up some god damn barricades. I be paranoid every time. The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'. The problem is I be textin'. My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired. First song they played for me. was 'bout their friend that just died. Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive. That's why I'd rather take the 405. I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim. But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him. I had my life threatened by best friends. who had selfish intents. What I'm supposed to do?. Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?. Every agent I know, know I hate agents. I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant. Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance. It's just me, I do it my way, bitch. Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans. If I knew y'all made plans. I wouldn't have popped the Xans. I know some fans. who thought I wouldn't rap like this again. But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans. A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems. Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it. It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out. And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out. God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam. Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me. Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!. I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full. Bitches say he funny and disrespectful. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes. I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news. I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house. Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out. We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots. Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop. She brace herself and hold my stomach. good dick'll do that. She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that. She push me back when the dick go too deep. This good dick'll put your ass to sleep. Get money, money, money, money. Big, big money, money, money, money. And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em. Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker. [Bridge: Larry Graham]. I just keep on lovin' you, baby. And there's no one else I know who can take your place. [Hook: Kanye West]. Please, no more parties in L. A. Please, baby, no more parties in L. A. , uh. No more parties in L. A. Please, baby, no more parties in L. A. , uh. No more parties in L. A. Please, baby, no more parties in L. A. , uh. No more (Los Angeles). [Outro: Junie Morrison]. I'm out here from a very far away place. All for a chance to be a star. Nowhere seems to be too far. Swish",

All my fault to be a real boy, chasin the American dream. Chasin everything we seen, up on the Tv screen. And when the Benz was left, and the clothes was left. And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death. Thinkin' the money that the-. You spend the dough to death. And tell me what be left, for a real boy!. They say \"Kanye, you keep it too real boy\".

Complex wrecks wrecks, my style go X X. I move around off beat, creatin more styles. Showin white boys, other kids my black styles. I kick lyrics like shoes right in your face. Walk up on a carJack of Spades, pluck the ace. I get slow-er, down in, on in. Flowin like I used to be on Critical Beatdown. I drop styles on ears the public bite em. Not many went to school, so the dummies wouldn't write em. They say yo Keith, yo Kool, you usin big words. I went to college, I'm even more stupid herb. Back on the scene to put a lesson out. Even if I have to pull a black Smith and Wesson out. I grab a hammer stick a nail in that little crack. Tame the monkey show the hummingbird how to act. I get atomic, hypo-galactical. Word to mom I'm in my own world. Galaxy raised! Powerful. Chorus:. Raise it up (8X). Verse Two: Ced G. Yo, yo money grip money grip, now this ain't no ego trip. Yo money grip money grip, now this ain't no ego trip. Now back in the days and we used to use elevation. And then the people said \"What's up, with UltraMagnetic?. Yo they sound kind of crazy, Kool Keith is a psycho. Ced G is a scientist, the lyrics are hyper\". Creating a fusion, of sampling hits. We all came down just to be distinctive. Some rappers complex, but they can't see the music. We show orchestration, and with funky prevention. It was different and black, and it caused devestation. Gotta new bag, signed a deal with Wild Pitch. Now we're back on the street, with the flavor you missed. So get with the program, Ultra hot off your real high. I know I'm a real pro, like Michigan Fab 5. Runnin and shootin, for me alley-oopin. Is makin an album, with big distribution. Promote it and hype it, make up posters then snipe it. Raise it up!. Chorus. Interlude: Announcer. Ladies and gentlemen, live from Flatbush Brooklyn. I bring to you tonight, the Godfather Don. From the Orphans.... (\"Hit it!\"). Verse Three: Godfather Don. Lookin down the barrel of a gun is no fun. So for some, I rum-pum-pum and flip, like a tongue. of young dragon, with the force and ten sacks of buddah. To wax a crew of jacks and looters, even your hoe I shoot her. In the face, with the mother-uffin bass. Now taste the venom of the ish that I sent em. And foes, that doze, I chew em like gristle. Wipe my mouth with tissue, there's no issue. I'm first print, mint, check the wizard. The force of my blast, blow em like a Tec in a blizzard. Now what is it? Exquisite physics to stain your brain. When they visit cardiovascular masterer, words are massacred damn. I got beats rhymes tanks gats includin Ultra. Check the loop, snoop low we do ya like a vulture. Back in the days, there was just beef and knuckles. Nowadays, a beatdown consists of some clips. My oowop, rips with abandon at random. Whiff, you be ghost, like Michael Landon. When I bust amazing nuts you play the cut. The Father's Ultra paid, I raise it... up. Chorus: repeat 2X",

But I know that if I stay stunting. All these girls only gon' want one thing. I could spend my whole life good will hunting. Only good gon' come is it's good when I'm coming. She got an ass that'll swallow up her G-string. And up top, uh, two bee stings. And I'm beasting, off the re-sling. And my nigga just made it out the precinct. We give a damn about the drama that you do bring. I'm just tryna change the color on your mood ring. Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things. Have you ever had shoes without shoestrings?.

Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt. And like my wife said, I still didn't say no. People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter. My friends' best advice was to stay low. I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills. Especially when you got family members on payroll. The media said it was outlandish spendin'. The media said he's way out of control. I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'. I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control. I know I'm the most influential. That Time cover was just confirmation. This generation's closest thing to Einstein. So don't worry about me, I'm fine. I can see a thousand years from now in real life. Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Troll conventional thought, don't need to question. I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive. Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission. Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions. Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission. Yeezy with the big house, did it way different. Never listen to Hollywood producers. Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa. The ultimate Gemini has survived. I wasn't supposed to make it past 25. Sampha. And you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. I've been looking in the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. (Father, father, father...). Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby. Kanye West. I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come. A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums. I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro. If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho. Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation. He sat back and smiled. Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime. The jews share they truth on how to make a dime. Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook. But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout \"how my neck look? \". Well it all looks great. Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains. The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard. Real family stick together and see through the mirage. The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality. Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?. I am one with the people. I am one with the people (real). I've been workin' from enlightened man's dream. Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem. Let me not say too much or do too much. Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch. I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen. So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping. God, I have humbled myself before the court. Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort. I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams. One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me. When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me. One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me. When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me. Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see. I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov. I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove. But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks. Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'mma never go broke. Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go. We all go. Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo. She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo. Modern day Mj with an off the wall flow. Sampha. My life walk all over me. Walk all over me. I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring. Fly, fly, fly overseas. Fly overseas. Oh, anywhere, everything but in between. Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Please face me when I speak. Please say to me something before you leave. You've been treating me like I'm invisible. Now I'm visible to you, oh, invisible truths. They say I can't quite understand what you say. Understand, understand. Understand I'm standing on the oath. With my hand on the book. Tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth. And you always give me half of you, half of you. Take half a shot, watching all my heart of gold. Make you feel like something from a film, oh. Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. I've been looking in the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky. (Father, father, father).

I know you see me now right now. (Right now, right now). I know you see me now right now. (Right now). I know you see me now right now. Pour the champagne, let your watch show. Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal. I admit my first watch was a Fossil. Now I'm in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils. Attention to detail is so uncanny. And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry. Somebody need to put us on camera. The world of Rollies and everyone families. Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris. Cute, your shorty watch Barneys, we at de Bonny's. End up at Marley, Georgi, and service from Sergio. Da Kine Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo. I know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical. This the Christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two. Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder 'Ye. 'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae. I got styled last June and she heard of me. I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate. First of all, we all know the beats is. Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus. Imagine the direction of this Immaculate conception. Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is paegantries. Cannonball off the diving board when I aboard. All my homies Gds, but I am lord. Rap god, Greek mythology. And this life too crazy to think logically. Here's something that you could use in analogy. My life is like a child's illusions become reality. Now go get my throne. 'Cause I don't wanna stop. I just go in my zone. And I'ma make it hot. 'Til it's time to go. When it's time to go. Where you tryna go?. You better act like you can see me now. Exactly!. I know you see me now right now. (I know you see me now right now). I know you see me now right now. (Right now, right now). I know you see me now right now. (Right now). I know you see me now right now. I know you see me. I know you see me. I know you see me. It's like I'm 3d. I know you see me now right now. (I know you see me now right now).

You lookin' good today, too. I like that. You got your new suit on. And she got the extra cute on. I know you thinkin' \"This that Yeezy we all love\". I'm back, baby. We back, baby!. Uncle Charlie, by the way. And I'mma let you finish, but I got Beyonce on the track. That's what it is. Black excellence, baby. We the elite. We the greatest in the world!. We the greatest in the world!. Yeah, Lex Luger, No I.D., Yeezy",

She say \"Can you get my friends in the club? \". I say \"Can you get my Benz in the club? \". If not, treat your friends like my Benz. Park they ass outside 'til the evening end. When I go raw, I like to leave it in. When I wake up, I like to go again. When I go to work, she gotta call it in. She can't go to work, same clothes again. And her heart colder than the souls of men. Louboutin on the toes again. Tight dress dancing close to him. Yeezus just rose again. [Hook]. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down.

If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him. After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up. Let's go back, back to the Gap. Look at my check, wasn't no scratch. So if I stole, wasn't my fault. Yeah I stole, never got caught. They take me to the back and pat me. Askin' me about some khakis. But let some black people walk in. I bet they show off their token blackie. Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store. Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'. Takin' my hits, writin' my hits. Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind. This fuckin' job can't help him. So I quit, y'all welcome. Y'all don't know my struggle. Y'all can't match my hustle. You can't catch my hustle. You can't fathom my love dude. Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers. That's a different world like three summers. I deserve to do these numbers.

Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky. Let's go, yeah. And I didn't even try to work a job. Represent the mob. At the same time thirsty on the grind. Chi state of mind. Lost my momma, lost my mind. +My life, my love+ that's not mine. Why you ain't signed?. Wasn't my time. Leave me alone, work for y'all. Half of it's yours, half of it's mine. Only one to ball. Never one to fall. Gotta get mine. Gotta take mine. Got a tech nine. Reach my prime. Gotta make these haters respect mine. In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine. Puttin' known ass on shelves. Waitin' paitently I ask myself. Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be. Life is much more than runnin' in the streets. Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat. Put me on my feet. Sound so sweet. Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee. Stayin' low key, nope. Holler at God \"Man why'd you had to take my folks?\". Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G. Love my G, Rolly G. Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's. Got a lot of people countin' on me. And I'm just tryin' to find my peace. Should of finished school like my niece. Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow. Aw man, all this pressure. [Hook: GLC]. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. [Verse 3: Consequence]. I remember havin' to take the dollar cab. Comin' home real late at night. Standin' on my feet all damn day. Tryin' to make this thing right. And havin' one of my co-workers say \"Yo you look just like. This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night\". Well easy come, easy go. How that sayin' goes. No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows. I all had that snatched from me. And all the faculties all turn their back on me. And didn't wanna hear a rap from me. So naturally actually had to face things factually. Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me. Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair. I don't wanna ever go back there. So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off. [Hook: GLC]. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit. I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky. [Outro: GLC]. I wanna fly, I wanna fly. I said I want my chariot to pick me up.

And when The Workout Plan ain't work out man. Me and Common is back on the corners again. On the corner. [Common]. Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. I open my eyes. The corner is like African tribes. The black is subsidized. The black enterprize. The passion arise. The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes. If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize. Tryna' build a spot where ghetto bastards can rise. The ghetto has been bastardized by those who capitalize. Wonder if its a plan that the master devised. To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised. On the corner",

The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night, the grind, the empty bottles of no doze. Tank on empty whippin my moma Volvo. I spent that gas money on clothes with logos. The furrest-ur man, shit that you don't floss. The goal yard so hard man I'm Hugo's boss. Why I gotta ask what that two door cost?. House in the Hills two doors from Tracee Ross. And I'm asking about her girlfriends, yeah the dark skinned ones. She asking about the speedboat assignment we rentin' 'em. When you meet me in person, what do you feel like?. I know, I know, I look better in real life. I hear people compare themselves to Big a lot. You know, Big and Pac, you know to get it hot. I guess after I live I wanna be compared to Big. Any one Big Pun, Big L or Notorious. Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious. And I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit.

And good day New York, have a good day in court. My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good yay' to snort. I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe. Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy. From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try. You know that old saying what they say about good guys. I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad. Fiends needed hits bad, started hittin liq' bad. Had to get that work off before that shit went bad. If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad. So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and. Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break. Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes. I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day. So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly. And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, cuz I'm ugly ducklin. Got a stain and its musty, wakin up looking crusty. And miss thang who's ugly is sayin to me “don't touch me”. I went from pretty willie to pretty silly. But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly. And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. Chorus 1: [Kanye West]. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. Niggaz give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. And this for the hood, you got to love me. [Kanye West]. Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name. But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and. Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down. And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down. And she ain't got a car she on the bus now. But her gear is bangin, she one of us now. I wanted badly to bone cuz she was bad to the bone. She from a batter home, she mad when she at home. So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off. Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off. The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise. She said “I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes”. And I get bougie in a Grey Poupon mood. So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood. She said “Ye' you don't love me?”. I told her it was good it's to bad it got ugly. Chorus 2:. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. And this for the hood, you got to love me. [Consequence]. Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene. And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team. See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly. And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly. Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly. And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly. Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly. I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly. Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly. And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly. Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies. But I took it all back, cuz God don't like ugly. Now I'm curbin my bad words, they say that the bad burn. I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm. Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn. And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs. The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it. But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it. So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood. But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood. And once it get bad, it be bad for good. THAT'S BAD MEANING BAD NOT BAD MEANING GOOD. But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good. Its all good in the hood, got called good cuz I'm good. Now I'm havin some good nights, livin this good life. Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife. So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go. Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know. And he came home for good, off of good behavior. Spittin that good game, so what's good with this paper. And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies. We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly. Chorus",

Yelling \"What up? \" The jeans cost $500? Fuck. Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement. One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid.

Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it. Could have been livin' it, you was Mrs. Mischievous. This is just a letter to better your development. Situation delicate. [Verse 3: Pusha T]. Some claim God body, blame Illuminati. All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair. Yeah, all Sonny no Cher, only solitaires. You clusterfucks could cluster up. On tippy-toe and still not muster up.

I'm chillin' in my camo, flippin' through the channel. On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo. Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching. To make your body switch another position. [Verse 5: CyHi Da Prince]. I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul. I gave it back to God at my christening. It's tickelin' when I hear what haters be whisperin'. What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?. Fake friends and siblings. Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in. Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car. But you can't spell war without an A-R. 15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart. By 21 they said I'd be inside a graveyard. Can't wait to get that black American Express. So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card. [Break: Kid Cudi and Kanye West].

Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money nigga?. (Naw man, mad people was frontin'. Aw man, made something from nothing). [Outro: Kanye West]. I treat the label like money from my shows. GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's. If I knew she was cheatin' and still bought her more clothes. It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know. Some people call that the art of war, you know. I guess it depends what you fallin' for, the clothes?. Cars, money, girls and the clothes. Aw money, you sold your soul.

But God don't ever give me nothin I cant handle. So please don't ever give me records I cant sample. So I could vacate where it aint no channels. but it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals. They say because of the fame and stardom. I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum. I guess it's messin with my health then. And this verse so crazy when I finish. I'm just gon check myself in - again. [Chorus]. [Kanye West:] \"Uh!\" (hey!). [Verse 3: Common]. They say \"Dude think he righteous\". I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers. Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is. On my paper, whether its weed or Isis. They say \"life is a game,\" so I play hard. Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job. They say \"Sef kept the hood together\". I tell the young, \"We can't play the hood forever\". Play my cards right, they say I went to left. They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F. Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights. Now I claim \"King\" like Don, or Frank White. They say my life is comparable to Christ's. The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice. They say \"The crochet pants and the sweater was wack\". Seen \"The Corner\", now they say \"That nigga's back,\" uh.... [Chorus]",

I'll probably risk it all right now. It's a life or death situation man. Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man. It's your boy Kayne to the..... Chi-Town what's going on man. [Verse 1]. I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert. Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp. That right there could drive a sane man beserk. Not to worry the Mr. H to the Izz-O's back to wizzerk. How do you console my mom or give her light support. Telling her your sons' on life support. And just imagine how my girl feel. On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like EMMITT TILL. She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine. She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign. No use of me tryna be lyin. I been trying to be signed. Trying to be a millionaire. How I use two lifelines. In the same hospital where Biggie smalls died. The doctor said I had blood clots. But I ain't Jamaican man. Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band. I swear this right here, history in the making man. I really apologize how I sound right now man. This ain't fair at all man. They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks. You know we had reconstru..... I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw. Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth. I couldn't believe it. But im still here for yall right now man. This is what I gotta say yo. Yeah, turn me up yeah. [Verse 2]. What if somebody from the shadow. that was ill got a deal. on the hottest rap label around. but he wasn't talking bout coke and birds. it was more like spoken word. Except he really putting it down. And he explained the story. about how blacks came from glory. And what we need to do in the game. Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time. In the blink of an eye his whole life changed. If you could feel how my face felt. you would know how Mase felt. Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt. I swear to God drive a two on the sue. I got a lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe-safe. My dawgs couldn't tell if I,. I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky. IT WAS TELEVISED. THERE'S BEEN AN accident like GEICO. They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael. I must gotta angel. Cause look how death missed his ass. Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass. Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past. Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash. And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid. Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did. But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph. Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire. Know what im saying. When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin to have to have a plate on my chin. I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now. Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on.

Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score. This a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola. I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that. Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs. Like, \"These niggas tryna hold me back. These niggas tryna hold me back\", I'm just trying to protect my stacks. Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax. Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back. Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?. \"Ease up there baby boy\", Ving Rhames told Jody that. R. Kelly and the God of rap. Shitting on you, holy crap. [Hook]. [Outro: Teyana Taylor]. I could give it all up, but it's not enough. Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger. To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon.

I couldn't work the Lox (locks).. Now let's go.. Take 'em back to the plan.... Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.. Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,. Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.. Let's take 'em back to the club.. Least about an hour I would stand on line,. I just wanted to dance.. I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.. I just wanted to shine.. Jay's favorite line: \"Dog, in due time\". Now he look at me, like \"Damn, dog, you where I am\". A hip hop legend.. I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.. [Chorus]. [Hook 1 (Lupe Fiasco)]. Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la. (Top of the world, baby.

Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,. I'd do anything to say \"I got it\".. Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.. Before anybody wanted K-West beats,. Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.. Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,. Like \"Damn, these niggas that much better than me?\". Baby, I'm going on an airplane,. And I don't know if I'll be back again.. Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,. But when she came to kick it, things became different.. Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.. I couldn't keep it home,. I thought I needed a Nia Long.. I'm trying to write my wrongs,. But it's funny these same wrongs. Helped me write this song.. Now,. [Chorus 2]. I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly.

Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?. Lupe still like Lupin the Third.. Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb. Peach fuzz buzz but bit on the verge. Hold it down like we're on the serve. Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.. But, before you say another word,. I'm back on the block like a man on the street.. I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra,. But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.. Engarde, Touch© Lupe cool as the Unthar,. But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.. I come as correct as a porn star,. In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.. So, I represent the first.. Now, let me hear my verse right where the horns are like. [Chorus 2]. (We back at home, baby). Sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. Sky, Sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. Yeah! (Keep it rollin). (Feels good to be home, baby!

Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night). They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off. Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off. Colors drippin' off. Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters. Niggas is pimps, niggas is players. 'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious. Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma. 'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture. Not somethin' to conquer. I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster. Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly. I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin. Nigga, do we have a problem?. Matter of fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers. I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges. No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters. Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates. Just play piano and stick to karate. I pray your body's draped more like mine. And not like your mommy's. Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts. And I am a nigga, I know what they want. I pray that you don't get it all at once. Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net. All in the comments, you wanna vomit. That's your baby, you love her to death. Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends. You break a glass and say it again. She can't comprehend the danger she in. If you whoop her ass, she move in with him. Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again. But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?. Let's pray we can put this behind us. I swear that these times is the wildest. She got the scars, they serve as reminders. Blood still on her pajamas. But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence. Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar. 'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters. Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters.

On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades. Music, rhymin' good like escalates. In the ghetto infested by shade and drama. And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma. I'm thinkin' big like Little Wayne in the (?). [Chorus]. [Rhymefest]. C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts. Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports.

You are about to experience something cold man. We never had nothing handed took nothing for granted. Took nothing from no man, man i'm my own man. But as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman. Only adult man i knew that wasnt a broke man. Flickin starter coats man, Man you ount no man. We don't care what people say. This is for my niggas outside all winter. Cuz this summer they aint finna to say next summer im finna. Sittin in the hood like community colleges. This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship. Cause aint no to tuition for havin no ambition. And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home. So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job. You gotta do something man your ass is grown. [Chorus]. [Kanye West:].

Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse Two:]. The second verse is for my dogs working 9 to 5. That still hustle cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55. And everybody selling make-up, Jacobs. And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up. We put shit on layaway then come back. We claim other kids on our income tax. We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid. And we don't care what people say. Momma say she wanna move south. Scratchin lottery tickets Eyes on a new house. Around the same time Doe ran up in dudes house. Couldnt get a job. So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work. The drug game bolemic its hard to get weight. So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight. So we gon keep baking to the day we get cake.. And we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus]. [Kanye West and Kids:].

Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say. [Verse Three:]. You know the kids gonna act a fool. When you stop the programs for after school. And they DCFS them some of them dislecsic. They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions. We scream, rock, blows, weed park. so now we smart. We aint retards the way teachers taught. Hold up hold fast we make mo'cash. Now tell my momma i belong in the slow class. It's bad enough we on welfare. You trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair. Im trying to get the car with the chromy wheels here. You tryin to cut our lights like we dont live here. Look at whats handed us our fatheres abandoned us. When we get the hammers gone and call the ambulance. Sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us. But we dont care what people say. My Niggas. [Chorus].

Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation. Hpnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser. Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior. Best things are green now pimp and get your paper. High off the ground instead of skyscraper. Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major. We major (come on, homie, we major) [repeat]. Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon. Better than a chick that say yes to soon. Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma. And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.. Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up. Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up. Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?. Get they first car and then IRS show up. He ain't never had shit but he had that nine. Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine. Put two and two together in a little bad weather. Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line. Ask the reverand was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school. That's all I want like wino's want they good whisky. I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me. [chorus]. [Nas:]. I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write. First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?. Four-four's or black christ? Both flows would be nice. Rap about big paper or the black man's plight. At the studio consol asked my man to the right. What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?. He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic. Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel. Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed. Now I'm a free agent. And I'm thinking it's time. To build my very own Motown. Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s. And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life. And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic. So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt. I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed. I survived the livest niggas around. Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns. Look, I used to cook before I had the game took. Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.. Feeling better than I ever felt before today. Like better late than never is orientation. Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away. [chorus]",

Just me and you girl. (Wooooah oooh). We have problems but thats all in the past. Everybody got problems baby I got a past. Remember I used to do things that would make you laugh. Like ordering girl drinks in a masculine glass. You like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain. Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain. Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains. And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name. But they never let us do our thing. Everybody lying on who I bang. We was on fire but they blew our flame. Ain't no denying baby you have changed. Cause now your high heels clicking. Your lip gloss glisten. Your hips start switching. You're pissed off, tripping. Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different. Friends all diss him like ‘no he didn't?'. No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?. Is that bitch still stripping?. Tryna to get a pair of Christian's?. I swear to God that they got you going crazy. But you play it off and say how it's work baby. Well some of the models is too coked to walk straight. But seem to still love the man that they all hate. But babe I call you back and say that you say that always. It kept me on the phone and demanded they always. See, she knew about all my lies the whole time. Now my credit so bad I can't get no one to co-sign. I woulda thought she woulda busted a dope crime. But she up and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign. Now she back in the club in a tight dress. With dreams of someday wearing a white dress. Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'a talk to a nigga. With a ten year ago swag. Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends. Quote unquote cause her girlfriends got girlfriends. On the phone hollin' at niggas is watever. Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever. Now she headed to Rome, Rome is the home. Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone. I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown. So I can't bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned. So a nigga had to hop on a plane. A bus and a train to try and come talk and explain. Rented the whole bottom floor for a candle light dinner. Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her. And told her even though I met you in a club in a tight dress. At first sight I can picture you in a white dress. 30 foot train, diamond from Lorraine. Just to make up for all the years and the pain. Family on both sides I'm so glad you came. Auntie couldn't make it, oh no, thats a shame. Wedding in June, what could be better. Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever. Take the very last car of the Eurostar. Tell the conductor just drive so far. Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited. Well we'll go to the country side and they won't be invited. We will not be disturbed by the fussing and fighting. Tell peaches light the herb, we just re-united, we just re-united. Lets make a move on these herds, go somewhere private. I'm talking just me and you and a plane and a pilot",

Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac. Like Vida Guerrera, ass took her to the top. She'll give you some brains you let her throw up the Roc. Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock. Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx. Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set. Putting oil on her likes like she Gloria Velez. She was (Eye Candy) in the XXL. Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell. I knew she {\"wouldn't get far\"} cause five hundred dollars. can't get you that {\"far\"} how you get that {\"far\"}. And all these new video bitches trying to be Melissa Ford. But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord. She a video vixen, but behind closed doors. She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards. Ha ha. [Chorus: The Game]. {\"You wouldn't get far\"} Fucking them rap stars. You know who you are, put your hands up ladies. {\"You wouldn't get far\"} If you kept your legs closed. {\"It would be best to wait your turn\"} But you know. {\"You wouldn't get far\"} Fucking them rap stars. You know who you are, I wrote this song for you. {\"For you baby, I'd find you\"} For you. And you, for alla y'all. [Kanye West]. For you... uhh... Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes. did I have under my belt, like boxers. Not to brag but, if it add up. One, two, nigga that's mad nuts. Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these. bitches knowing damn well they gon' call me?. The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen. was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen. Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team. Head so good he don't ask for a pre.. nup. Now ask yourself this question, umm. Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O. Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo. Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo. Well why the hell you think these bitches coming at me fo'?. But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio. Yo. [Chorus - sub \"mouth closed\" for \"legs closed\"]. [The Game]. I done had my share of bitches with long hair. Short doo like Kalissa, Halle in \"Boomerang\" yeah. I been around the block in the Bentley drop top. In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fucking with Scott. I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case. She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes. And ain't nobody trying to take Beyonce from Jay. But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day. The things niggaz do when pussy sitting on they face. Stabbed Un in the stomach. She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit. Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'. Impala, forget the double D's. I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Takara. And she ain't win the show but she riding in that Galata. That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow. [Chorus]. [The Game]. God damn! Y'knahmsayin?. I'm sitting back watching Kanye video. And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video. Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel. Checking out my uncle Snoop Dogg video. And I see the same BITCH, that was in my video! Y'knowhatI'msayin?. And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up. I'm watching Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina. I see the same bitch on Oprah, floating away on the hood of a Camry. That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video!. I mean DAMN! Everywhere I look. Everywhere I go I see the same hoes. Don't get mad, I'm only being real. Yeah",

Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls. My wife callin', screamin', say, \"we 'bout to lose it all! \". Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe. Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave. And I know you wouldn't leave. When somethin' frees. We doin' such things. We could wait longer than this. Yes, you know you're one of these. We can run through with the top chopped, yeah. And the sundress down, ooh. And I know you wouldn't leave. Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental. You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental. Every time somethin' happen, they want me sent to mental. We had an incident but I cover incidentals. You want me workin' on my messagin'. When I'm thinkin' like george jetson. But soundin' like george jefferson. Then they questionin' my methods then. If you tweakin' out on my texts again. Then I don't get reception here. I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere. I use the same attitude that done got us here. I live for now, I don't know what happen after here. I live for now, I don't know what happen after here. Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be. Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy. I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries. One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity. And I know you wouldn't leave. I don't feel like she's mine enough. God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up. Butterfly in my wrist. You make me run out of my skin (run out of my skin). And I don't feel like (uhh). And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me). For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me). Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me). Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me). She told you not to do that shit (ohh). She told you you's gon' fuck the money up. But you ain't wanna listen, did you?. Keep that same energy. Keep that same energy. Keep that same energy. Now you testin' her loyalty. This what they mean when they say. \"for better or for worse\", huh?. For every down female that stuck with they dude. Through the best times, through the worst times. This for you.

You had gap and gucci, that's still two g's. But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap. Ooh you so boozy boo you could of fooled me. Cuz five years ago you was so fugees. Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few g's. You like the light-skinned ania, the dark-skinned aaliyah. The black jennifer lopez, a ghetto senorita. You remind me of my jeep but not no kia. We can talk on your cell, but not nokia. It be goin' in and out, that's why i barely hear ya. It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah. I'm tryin' to +take this money+ like +robin geeda+.

Malik yusef, bet your baby momma know the name. The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game. I give you words spit with flames. Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames. Connoisseur of kama sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame. I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb. But my job was to hustle 'dro. Now an artist of the spoken word, i just hustle flow. Never a preety boy, always a +beautiful mind+ like russell crowe. Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go. I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends. But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side. And i no longer like you. Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to. [hook].

Deep as the ocean is the motion of life. Thought you would have been the sister i chose for my wife. Not knowin' you was trife. Stiflin' a nigga's growth. All you wanna do is shop at river oaks. Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke. I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope. Thought my +real nigga quotes+ would make you truer. You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor. The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter. There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper. I look through the mirror and see my reflection. It ain't in your direction so i passed her like a reverend. Return to my bitch and wine ways goin' wild like west and kanye. Wherever i lay my kufi is my home, goddamnit i'm grown. Broke broad i'ma leave your ass alone. You still wanna ride though. [hook].

Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though. But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?. Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?. It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against. You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print. You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit. It's bigger than your selfish agenda. If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas. Then shit…. Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people. Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal. You gotta see the vantage point of the people. What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil. See that's the problem with this damn nation. All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man. We ain't made it off the plantation. Fuck who you choose as your political party. You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted. With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position. Don't you feel an obligation to them?. I feel a obligation to show people new ideas. And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here. Make America Great Again had a negative perception. I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction. Added empathy, care and love and affection. And y'all simply questionin' my methods. What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?. This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you. You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views. As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you. All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie. Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie. That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now. 'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down. You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?. I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half. Then one day I was like, \"Fuck it, I'ma do me. \". I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me. Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up. Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up. The greater good of the people is first. Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?. You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse. This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church. Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different. Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand. I know everybody emotional. Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?. Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?. Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?. You'll deal with God for the lack of respect. Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check. Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that. What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?. Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bitch. Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget. And all that free thought shit, find a better defense. But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that. Fuck it. Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man. Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?",

On the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day. ''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''. Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed. (Jj Fad). Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa. You assuming I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you. I'm superhuman. Innovative and I'm made of rubber. So that anything you saying. Ricocheting off of me. And it'll glue to you. I'm never stating. More than never demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience. A feeling like it's levitating. Never fading. And I know that the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off. They'd be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. Oh, he's too mainstream. Well, that's what they do. When they get jealous, they confuse it. It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it. I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use. Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm ripping any one of these verses. Diverse as you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to prove. That if you're half as nice at songs. You can sacrifice virgins too. School flunkie, pill junky. But look at the accolades the skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself cause I make me do. What I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues. But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel. I'm asleep in the front seat. Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still \"Chunky, But Funky\". But in my head there's something. I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils. Here's what they want from me. They asking me to eliminate. Some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration. The bitter hatred that I had. Then you may be a little patient. And more symphatetic to the situation. And understand the discrimation. But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then. But if I can't batter the women how the fuck. Am I supposed to bake them a cake then?. Don't mistake it for Satan. It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas. And take a vacation to trip a broad. And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard. Be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?",

For the day that they can say I fell off. They'd be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. Oh, he's too mainstream. Well, that's what they do. When they get jealous, they confuse it. It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it. I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use. Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm ripping any one of these verses. Diverse as you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to prove. That if you're half as nice at songs. You can sacrifice virgins too. School flunkie, pill junky. But look at the accolades the skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself cause I make me do. What I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues. But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel. I'm asleep in the front seat. Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still \"Chunky, But Funky\". But in my head there's something. I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils. Here's what they want from me. They asking me to eliminate. Some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration. The bitter hatred that I had. Then you may be a little patient. And more symphatetic to the situation. And understand the discrimation. But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then. But if I can't batter the women how the fuck. Am I supposed to bake them a cake then?. Don't mistake it for Satan. It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas. And take a vacation to trip a broad. And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard. Be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?",

                  "Lyric": "Come on come on. I see no changes.. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself,. \"Is life worth living?. Should I blast myself?\". I'm tired of bein' poor. and even worse I'm black.. My stomach hurts,. so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.. Cops give a damn about a negro?. Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero.. Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares?. One less hungry mouth on the welfare.. First ship 'em dope. And let 'em deal the brothers.. Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.. \"It's time to fight back\", that's what Huey said.. 2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.. I got love for my brother,. but we can never go nowhere. unless we share with each other.. We gotta start makin' changes.. Learn to see me as a brother. 'stead of 2 distant strangers.. And that's how it's supposed to be.. How can the Devil take a brother. if he's close to me?. I'd love to go back to when we played as kids,. but things change, and that's the way it is.. Chorus. (Come on, come on). That's just the way it is.. Things'll never be the same.. That's just the way it is. aww yeah.... (Come on, come on). That's just the way it is.. Things'll never be the same.. That's just the way it is. aww yeah.... I see no changes. All I see is racist faces.. Misplaced hate makes disgrace for races we under.. I wonder what it takes to make this one better place.... let's erase the wasted.. Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.. 'Cause mo' black than white. is smokin' crack tonight.. And only time we chill is when we kill each other.. It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.. And although it seems heaven sent,. we ain't ready to see a black President, uhh.. It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact.... the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.. But some things will never change.. Try to show another way,. but they stayin' in the dope game.. Now tell me what's a mother to do?. Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.. You gotta operate the easy way.. \"I made a G today\" But you made it in a sleazy way.. Sellin' crack to the kids. \"I gotta get paid,\". Well hey, well that's the way it is.. (Come on, come on). That's just the way it is.. Things'll never be the same.. That's just the way it is. aww yeah.... We gotta make a change.... It's time for us as a people. to start makin' some changes.. Let's change the way we eat,. let's change the way we live. and let's change the way we treat each other.. You see the old way wasn't working. so it's on us to do. what we gotta do, to survive.. And still I see no changes.. Can't a brother get a little peace?. There's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East.. Instead of war on poverty,. they got a war on drugs. so the police can bother me.. And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.. But now I'm back with the facts. givin' 'em back to you.. Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,. crack you up and pimp smack you up.. You gotta learn to hold ya own.. They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.. But tell the cops they can't touch this.. I don't trust this, when they try to rush. I bust this.. That's the sound of my tune.. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.. And as long as I stay black,. I gotta stay strapped & I never get to lay back.. 'Cause I always got to worry. 'bout the pay backs.. Some buck that I roughed up way back.... comin' back after all these years.. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh. [Bridge 'til fade]. (Come on, come on) That's just the way it is.. Things'll never be the same.. That's just the way it is. aww yeah.... Some things never change.",

Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. When I see you again. First, you both go out your way. And the vibe is feeling strong. And what's small turn to a friendship. A friendship turned into a bond. And that bond will never be broken. The love will never get lost. And when brotherhood come first. Then the line will never be crossed. Established it on our own. When that line had to be drawn. And that line is what we reached. So remember me when I'm gone. How could we not talk about family. When family's all that we got?. Everything I went through. You were standing there by my side. And now you gonna be with me for the last ride. So let the light guide your way. Hold every memory as you go. And every road you take. Will always lead you home.

But baby that's just me. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always. Now your pictures that you left behind. Are just memories of a different life. Some that made us laugh. Some that made us cry. One that made you have to say good bye. What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair. To touch your lips to hold you near. When you say your prayers try to understand. I've made mistakes I'm just a man. When he holds you close. When he pulls you near. When he says the words. You've been needing to hear. I'll wish I was him cause these words are mine. To say to you till the end of time. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. If you told me to cry for you I could. If you told me to die for you I would. Take a look at my face. There's no price I won't pay. To say these words to you. Well there ain't no luck in this loaded dice. But baby if you give me just one more try. We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives. We'll find a place where the sun still shines. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always",

Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?. All in all it was just a brick in the wall.. All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.. \"You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still lady!\". When we grew up and went to school. There were certain teachers who would. Hurt the children in any way they could. (oof!). By pouring their derision. Upon anything we did. And exposing every weakness. However carefully hidden by the kids. But in the town it was well known. When they got home at night, their fat and. Psychopathic wives would thrash them. Within inches of their lives.. Parte 2. We don't need no education. We dont need no thought control. No dark sarcasm in the classroom. Teachers leave them kids alone. Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!. All in all it's just another brick in the wall.. All in all you're just another brick in the wall.. We don't need no education. We don't need no thought control. No dark sarcasm in the classroom. Teachers leave us kids alone. Hey! Teachers! Leave us kids alone!. All in all it's just another brick in the wall.. All in all you're just another brick in the wall.. \"Wrong, Guess again! 2x. If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?. You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddie!\". Parte 3. I don't need no arms around me. And I don't need no drugs to calm me. I have seen the writing on the wall. Don't think I need anything at all. No! Don't think I'll need anything at all. All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.. All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.",

The world is closing in. Did you ever think. That we could be so close, like brothers. The future's in the air. I can feel it everywhere. Blowing with the wind of change. [Chorus:]. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change. Walking down the street. And distant memories. Are buried in the past forever. I follow the Moskva. Down to Gorky Park. Listening to the wind of change. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams. With you and me. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change. The wind of change blows straight. Into the face of time. Like a stormwind that will ring. The freedom bell for peace of mind. Let your balalaika sing. What my guitar wants to say. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams. With you and me. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change",

Once touch is what he thought was grip. This not his hands those there but mine. And safe, my hands to seek to gain. All knowledge of my master's manly rain. The scented taste that stills my tongue. Is wrong that is set but not undone. His fiery eyes can slash my savage skin. And force all seriousness away. He wades in close waters. Deep sleep alters his senses. I must obey my only rival. He will command our twin revival. The same insane sustain again. (The two of us so close to our own hearts). I silence and wrote. This awe of coincidence",

In the white sand, the old man. trembling, smokes his pipe. only the water and I know. why he needs this fan. The idea sleeps like a volcano. hesitating, I asked him then. his head bent, it seemed he slept. he said before he died. The water shall be your mirror. if it is smooth you will see. how many fairy tales remain for you. and you will plead for your redemption. The fan pressed against his body. the hand stiffens with rigor mortis. they had to break his fingers. the fan remains back in the sand. I call the old one every day. he would like to redeem me. I remain back in the midday's wind. and I can read in the fan. The water shall be your mirror. if it is smooth you will see. how many fairy tales remain for you. and you will plead for your redemption.",
